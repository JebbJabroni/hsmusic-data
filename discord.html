<p>We have a public Discord server - <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6Cyt9TY">you're welcomed to join!</a></p>
<p>We mostly discuss work-in-progress site updates here, sharing feedback and suggestions before (and after!) releases go online.</p>
<p>There are a few rules you'll have to read and accept before being let in, and we take moderation seriously - but the server is a pretty chill space in general! The rules are just there to ensure it <i>can</i> be safe and relaxed for everyone.</p>
<p>(Discord not your style? <a href="feedback/">Check our other links!</a>)</p>
