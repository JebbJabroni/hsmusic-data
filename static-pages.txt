    Welcome to HSMusic, a fan-made Homestuck music wiki!
    <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">Homestuck</a> has always been an incredible creative collaboration, and especially beloved by the community and critical in that collaboration is the webcomic and world's humongous soundtrack, comprising well over 500 tracks by dozens of musicians and artists. This wiki aims to be an interesting and useful resource for anyone interested in that music, as well as an archive for all things related.
    Pertaining to the history of this site: it was originally made as a remake of Homestuck's official <a href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, which saw its content particularly reduced on <a href="https://twitter.com/hamesatron/status/1187842783618297856">10/25/19</a>. This site aims to be a more reliable resource and reference: track art (conspicuously missing from the Bandcamp) is archived here, solo albums (among other missing albums, like [[album:Squiddles!]]) are all indexed in the one place, and URLs will always stay consistent. And of course, also included are links for listening on Bandcamp and other services.
    Nowadays, HSMusic also operates as a center for all sorts of fan music, a sort-of home where avid listeners can explore, discover, and support artists and albums within the sphere around Homestuck music. We're always looking to share new music here, so if there's anything you'd like to see, please feel encouraged to <a href="feedback/">drop a message</a>!
    The code for this website is open source (GPL-3.0), and can be explored or forked <a href="https://notabug.org/hsmusic/hsmusic">here</a>. If you want to get in touch with feature requests or comments on the code, our contact info is <a href="feedback/">here</a>!

    - <a href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/">Homestuck's Bandcamp</a>, the official host of Homestuck's music: I got almost all the official album listings and basic track info from here.
    - GiovanH's <a href="https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=kZdJQ8kZNyIwh0Hn1ime6Ty7L2J87BE3E2ak">complete track art archive</a>: track art!

(Prior to this, I used the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190720035022/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/music">Web Archive</a> to gather track art.)
    - <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html">NSND</a>: leitmotifs! Thanks to this site in combination with credits on the bandcamp and artists' own commentary, this wiki is a rather comprehensive resource for leitmotifs and other track references.
    - <a href="https://www.bgreco.net/hsflash.html">bgreco.net (HQ Audio Flashes)</a>: thumbnail captures for the individual Flash animations! There were a couple captures missing that I took myself, but most Flash thumbnails are from here.</a>
    - The <a href="https://homestuck-and-mspa-music.fandom.com/wiki/Homestuck_and_MSPA_Music_Wiki">Homestuck and MSPA Music Wiki</a> on Fandom: the inspiration for this wiki! I've wanted to make a more complete and explorable wiki ever since seeing it. The Fandom wiki has also been a very handy reference in putting this together, so much thanks to everyone who's worked on it!
    - <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">homestuck.com</a>: Besides being the home of the comic this whole site is based around, <a href="static/bg.jpg">the wallpaper</a> for the site is pulled from <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/info-more">More from Homestuck</a>.

    <i>Feature &amp; Contribution Acknowledgements</i>
    - <b>Thank you,</b> GiovanH, for linking me to a resource for higher quality cover art, and bringing to my attention the fact that clicking a cover art on Bandcamp to zoom in will often reveal a higher quality image.
    - cosmogonicalAuthor, for a variety of feature requests and comments! In particular: improving way the track list on author pages is sorted; expanding the introduction; expanding the introduction message to the website; and linking bonus art for Homestuck Vol. 5 - plus a few other good suggestions I haven't gotten to yet. Thanks!
    - Monckat, for suggesting the album Strife 2 before I'd begun adding fandom-created albums and unofficial releases to this wiki, and for working with an emailer to reupload the original cover art for [[track:the-thirteenth-hour]].
    - Kidpen, for suggesting the "Flashes that feature this track" feature.
    - an emailer, for suggesting the "Random track" feature.
    - foreverFlumoxed, for pointing out that [[flash:338]] contains reference to [[JOHN DO THE WINDY THING]] (this reminded me to add all the unreleased Flash tracks to the Unreleased Tracks album!), for recommending the restructure to [[album:Unreleased Tracks]], and for going to the massive effort of checking every track page and pointing out a bunch of missing cover arts and title typos!
    - Makin, for various initial help in data collection (especially commentary) and lifting the site off the ground by pinning it to the top of the /r/homestuck subreddit for a while, and for linking me the independent release of <a href="https://jamesdever.bandcamp.com/album/sburb">Sburb</a>.
    - an emailer, for sending a crop of the YT thumbnail art for [[After the Sun]] (plus the SoundCloud link for that track), for reporting the "Random" buttons being broken, and for linking a bunch of resources and various official uploads of tracks and albums.
    - Niklink, for contributing immensely to the existing <a href="list/tracks/with-lyrics/">lyrics</a> on the wiki and transcribing plenty of new ones that had been totally missed before, as well as for help with archiving the early official album releases ([[album:homestuck-vol-1]] through [[album:homestuck-vol-4]]).
    - Nuclear, for a variety of valuable feedback and discussion, as well as for spearheading projects like the <a href="https://twitter.com/nueclear333/status/1336407226492178432">unofficial Pesterquest OST album &amp; metadata</a>.
    - Bambosh, for creating <a href="https://bambosh.github.io/unofficial-homestuck-collection/">The Unofficial Homestuck Collection</a> and integrating data from HSMusic so seamlessly into it, and for sharing a number of handy data fixes and comments.
    - Thanks for pointing out typos, errors in reference lists, and out of date details: cookiefonster, foreverFlummoxed, and an emailer.

    <strong>Feature requests?<br>Noticed any errors?<br>Itching to see that one album you love on the wiki?</strong>
    Please let us know! We appreciate feedback a lot, and always want to make this site better.
    There are five main channels you can reach the dev through:
    - <a href="discord/">HSMusic Community Discord Server</a> - The official Discord, and a friendly place to drop feedback or discuss the wiki. (We also share sneak peeks of the coming updates here frequently!)
    - <a href="https://forum.homestuck.xyz/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=151">HomestuckXYZ</a> - A public forum thread for the wiki.
    - <a href="https://twitter.com/sapphicGnostic">Twitter</a> - DMs for discussion or feedback are open! (It might go a while unnoticed, though - the site only indicates message requests when it's manually checked, and we're pretty terrible at remembering to do that!)
    - <a href="https://types.pl/@quasar">Mastodon</a> - Same as birdsite but a moderately less terrible platform :)
    - Email - it's towerofnix at gmail dot beans! (Same domain everyone else uses.) Old-fashioned, but personally our favorite of them all, and certainly practical if you're sending a longer-form message.
    Thanks so much for sharing your feedback!

    <h3>groups</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>new feature! groups are collections of fan albums, organized under a dedicated page for an external group or project.</li>
        <li>groups exist in three categories: <i>HSMusic</i>, <i>Fan-musician groups</i>, and <i>Projects beyond Homestuck</i> <ul>
            <li>HSMusic: overall structure for the wiki, containing [[group:official]] and [[group:fandom]], into which nearly all albums are categorized</li>
            <li>Fan-musician groups: collaborative groups of fan-musicians releasing music under a single name, e.g. [[group:casual-sunday]] and [[group:unofficial-mspa-fans]]</li>
            <li>Projects beyond Homestuck: groups centered around a particular work, usually inspired by Homestuck, e.g. [[group:undertale-and-deltarune]] and [[group:oceanfalls]]</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>groups each have two "tabs" or views: Info and Gallery <ul>
            <li>Info: this displays the full description for a group, and then a chronological list of albums (and their years of release)</li>
            <li>Gallery: replacing the previously dedicated pages for official and fandom albums, this displays a list of albums organized with their latest first, and has a short info line summarizing stats about the group</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>miniature group "infoboxes" are displayed on the right side of album and track pages <ul>
            <li>this design (alongside much of this update's layout changes) is inspired by the site layout of Bandcamp</li>
            <li>contains a short catchline introducing the group, links to visit the external homes of the group (e.g. its own Bandcamp or project links), and chronology links to navigate the previous and next albums within the group</li>
            <li>displayed at the bottom of the page in compact layout (e.g. when on a mobile device)</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>every artist who has contributed track or album cover art, e.g. [[artist:elanor-pam]], now has a gallery page; these are much the same as tag gallery pages but for artists</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>YouTube links for individual tracks no longer attach their playlist, because this was deemed Mostly Just Impractical in discussion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>listings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>added six new listings, for the new groups feature: <ul>
            <li><a href="list/groups/by-name/">Groups - by Name</a></li>
            <li><a href="list/groups/by-category/">Groups - by Category</a></li>

            <li><a href="list/groups/by-latest/">Groups - by Latest Album</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>adjusted the order of existing listings, to make them hopefully a little easier to navigate</li>
        <li>renamed the "Tracks - in Flashes &amp; Games (by First Feature)" listing to "... (by Flash)" and <a href="list/tracks/in-flashes/by-flash">considerably restructured it</a>, effectively making it into a compact summary of the <a href="flash/">Flashes &amp; Games</a> portion of the site</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>data changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>removed ?list parts from all track links</li>
        <li>added new album and group data (see respective above changelog sections)</li>

    <h2 id="12-dec-2020" class="major-release"><a href="#12-dec-2020">12 December 2020 - launch of hsmusic.wiki</a></h2>
    <h3>site changes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>redesigned the homepage from the ground up to be a better landing page for the wiki! <ul>
            <li>three groupings for the wiki index: New Releases, Fandom, Official, showing just a few so it's easy to navigate, with new buttons to view a complete grid listing</li>
            <li>moved the "Explore the site!" links over to the newly wiki-wide header, placing albums front and center while leaving navigation links readily accessible</li>
            <li>added a sidebar to the homepage, listing recent <a href="news/">news entries</a> parallel with albums</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>improved navigation all around the site, making the wiki as a whole more consistent <ul>
            <li>cover art displayed in grid items is smaller across the site, fitting more items on a screen at once and emphasizing the name more than before</li>
            <li>on the new <a href="albums/official/">Official</a> and <a href="albums/fandom/">Fandom</a> album indexes, the number of tracks and length of the album is displayed as well</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>added lazy loading for images, so landing pages shouldn't take up nearly as much data, and will load quicker (especially noticeable for the <a href="flash/">Flashes &amp; Games</a> index!)</li>
        <li>adjusted the styling for grouped listings (previously used only for [[album:unreleased-tracks]]) as they become more common (see data changes section)</li>
        <li>made links which require JavaScript only show up if JS is actually enabled</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>tags</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>new feature! tags are used for two things: categorizing track art by character, and displaying content warnings.</li>
        <li>added a tag list beneath most track and album arts describing characters in the image and linking to their gallery pages</li>
        <li>added tag gallery pages under the Listings section, showing a grid of all the track and album covers which are tagged with that character</li>
        <li>added content warnings for common triggers (alcohol, body horror, etc), blurring out the image and showing warning tags until it is clicked and revealed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>listings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>some extra wiki-wide stats are displayed on the <a href="list/">Listings index</a>!</li>
        <li>divided the <a href="list/artists/by-contribs/">Artists - by Contributions</a> and <a href="list/artists/by-latest/">Artists - by Latest Contribution</a> listings into two columns for easier exploring: "Track Contributors" and "Track &amp; Flash Contributors"</li>
        <li>added two new listings, for the new tags feature: <ul>
            <li><a href="list/tags/by-name">Tags - by Name</a></li>
            <li><a href="list/tags/by-uses">Tags - by Uses</a></li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    <ul>

    <h3>bug fixes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>fixed a bug where chronology links (e.g "413th track by Toby Fox") for track artists weren't being displayed anymore</li>
        <li>fixed a bug where artists with zero contributions (e.g. only commentary) would display as "( c.)" instead of "(0 c.)" in artist listings</li>
        <li>fixed a bug where flash names would <i>always</i> have the dot at the end of the name removed, instead of only when punctuation follows</li>
        <li>fixed some bugs with release date code where the <a href="list/artists/by-latest/">Artists - by Latest</a> listing would not count unique dates of cover art contributions (e.g. in anthology projects where fanart is added after the release of the album), and where the cover art release date displayed on album pages was ambiguous (previously it displayed the date of track art for the whole album; now it displays - or, if it is the same as album release, does not display - the date of cover art for the album itself)
        <li>fixed a bug on artist pages where tracks that are featured in more than one flash would display flashes past the first feature as "1", "2", "3", etc, instead of the actual flash names</li>
        <li>fixed a bug on artist pages where co-artists of tracks (but not track art) weren't being displayed anymore</li>
        <li>fixed a bug where the random official album link in the <a href="list/random/">Random Pages</a> listing would instead open a random track across the whole site</li>
        <li>made all the links on the <a href="list/random/">Random Pages</a> listing behave more like regular links (ctrl-click works for example)</li>

    <h3>miscellaneous</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>a new navigation header added to every album, track, flash, and listing page, making the site considerably more usable on any device</li>
        <li>the header has links to the previous and next (or random) track/flash, and chronology links have been moved into the header too, so you don't need to scroll to the bottom of the page to access them</li>
        <li>on top of redoing the sidebar-header layout, changes to styling (collapsing the sidebar when the screen isn't very wide, for example) have made the site usable on mobile devices now!</li>
        <li>also, some changes to the way pages are generated, to make the site usable from hit command-line web browser <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></li>

    </ul>
    <h3>album/track pages</h3>

        <li>these got their share of randomness too, in the form of a new "Random Track" link at the bottom of the sidebar</li>
        <li>cover art can now have a distinct release date from the album, which is the case for anthology projects that organize art for an album after it has been released</li>

        <li>the official album grid listing was changed to sort the newest releases closest to the top of the page, as bandcamp orders releases, to keep consistent with the fandom grid listing (where we want new releases to stand out right away)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>the "tracks that referenced" list is now grouped into two sections: official and fandom</li>

        <li>every flash page has a link to play the flash on homestuck.com, its page number, release date, and a list of the tracks featured in it</li>
        <li>the code to generate sidebar was absolute hell to write</li>

        <li>added a new "Explore the site!" box on the homepage, linking to the about page as well as the new <a href="list/">listings index</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>listings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>completely new pages for exploring the wiki in completely new ways; they serve as an alternative to writing a dynamic search engine, because github doesn't let us write a custom backend and client-side javascript sucks</li>
        <li>all linked from <a href="list/">listings index</a>, accessible through the sidebar</li>
        <li>there are nine of these but if you doubt i'm going to list them all, you're wrong</li>
        <li><a href="list/albums/by-name/">Albums - by Name:</a> every album, sorted alphabetically</li>
        <li><a href="list/albums/by-date/">Albums - by Date:</a> every album, sorted chronologically (at the time this was no different than the homepage grid listing's sort, but today it contains fandom albums interweaved with official ones)</li>
        <li><a href="list/albums/by-tracks/">Albums - by Tracks:</a> every album, sorted by number of tracks</li>
        <li><a href="list/artists/by-name/">Artists - by Name:</a> every artist, sorted by name (this also shows the number of contributions each artist has made next to their name)</li>

        <li><a href="list/artists/by-contribs/">Artists - by Contributions:</a> every artist, sorted by number of contributions (times credited as a contributor, to music or art, on any track or album)</li>

    <ul>
        <li>artist page credit listings have been sigificantly restructured (<a href="media/misc/changelog/old-artist-page.png">before</a>, <a href="media/misc/changelog/new-artist-page.png">after</a>)</li>
        <li>contributions are now grouped by album (or more specifically, by release date, which is noteworthy in the case of [[album:Homestuck Vol. 1-4]], which was originally released over a period of four distinct dates, plus one for the final compiled album release)</li>
        <li>because it's easy to see where tracks are referenced now, dim contribution lines (showing tracks which reference a track by the specific artist, but were not otherwise contributed to by them) have been removed</li>
        <li>the lists aren't numbered anymore because, with this grouping, it was sort of ambiguous whether that referred to a track's position in the album or if it was a continuous counter of the artist's contributions (it was the latter); both such counters can now be displayed by holding still the cursor over a contribution line for a moment</li>
        <li>removed a few referenced-track contributions i'd missed switching to the new format (distinct reference lists) earlier</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="18-nov-19"><a href="#18-nov-19">18 November 2019 - high-res cover art</a></h2>

        <li>copied cover art from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dn2s69/i_was_prepared_for_this_eventuality_and_also/">this archive</a>, which was originally compiled by clicking each cover art off the bandcamp to get a higher-resolution cover art (it is intentionally still less than the resolution gotten in purchased album downloads, for particularly high-res art)</li>
        <li>commentary for [[album:Hiveswap Act 1 OST]]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>homepage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>got rid of the twitter link on my name and added two links in its place - my twitter and reddit accounts - as well as a note that suggestions and feedback are welcome</li>

    <h3>track pages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>track references show up in a dedicated list now</li>
        <li>forward-facing reference links: track pages list not just the tracks they reference, but the tracks <i>which reference them</i></li>
        <li>reference data is from <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html"><dfn title="nobody knows what NSND stands for">NSND</dfn></a> (credited on the homepage)</li>
        <li>"listen on" links show up before the contributor list instead of after; reference list after contributor list</li>
        <li>at the very bottom, a new section for artist commentary, largely copied from <a href="https://pastebin.com/gqpHsKkE">this pastebin</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>added a message describing dim contribution lines: "Dim tracks are tracks that this artist contributed only a based-upon song to."</li>
        <li>for tracks with multiple contributors, those are listed as well, e.g. "(with Michael Guy Bowman)"</li>
        <li>note that this doesn't include "contributors" who only provided a referenced track, since those are now stored in a list separate from the contributors list</li>
        <li>a new section for commentary</li>
        <li>a "jump to" paragraph at the top, to quickly scroll to any of the track/art/commentary sections</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>published <a href="https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic.github.io/">on github</a> with code under the GPL; hosted on hsmusic.github.io</li>

        <li>(and maybe twitter but my account has long been deleted)</li>

    <h3>homepage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>an intro message which has since been moved to <a href="about/">About &amp; Credits</a></li>
        <li>a grid listing for the albums: all official releases, from [[album:Midnight Crew: Drawing Dead]] through [[album:Hiveswap Friendsim]]</li>

    <h3>album pages</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>track name, release date, artists (musicians), cover art &amp; art credits</li>
        <li>links to listen to the track too (and code to convert URLs into human-readable site names, e.g. "YouTube" or "Bandcamp" or "(External)")</li>
        <li>rudimentary leitmotif reference credits in the form of "Contributors" list</li>
        <li>contributors list also contains credited collaborators on the track, e.g. producers, vocalists</li>

    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>name, track and art credits</li>
        <li>artist pages look quite different from today but serve the same purpose of listing their contributions</li>
        <li><a href="changelog-misc/old-artist-page.png">here's an example</a></li>
        <li>credits are all in one numbered list; most are just the name of the track contributed to and the album it's from</li>
        <li>for tracks where an artist made a specific contribution, that's mentioned too, e.g. "Sburban Countdown (arrangement)"</li>
        <li>if a musician's contribution is simply a track which was referenced, the line for that contribution is slightly dim (it still contributes to the counter)</li>

    Thank you! There are two places you can support HSMusic:
    - <a href="https://www.patreon.com/qznebula">Patreon</a>, which should be straightforward to use if you've already set up an account.
    - <a href="https://liberapay.com/nebula">Liberapay</a>, which is a considerably more reliable platform than Patreon, but might take some setup to get working.
    As thanks for your support present or past, if you'd like (we'll message you!), we'll feature your name at the end of all coming news entries. (As far as we know, Liberapay doesn't display who is donating, so drop us a message if you donate there and would like to be part of the list!)
    As additional acknowledgment for donating CA$5 or more a month, we have a shiny <i style="color: #f1c40f">Supporter</i> role on <a href="discord/">the Discord server</a>! Patreon should give this to you automatically... but it's still a little experimental, so let us know if it doesn't, or if you're donating from Liberapay.
