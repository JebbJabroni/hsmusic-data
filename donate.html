<p>Thank you! There are two places you can support HSMusic:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/qznebula">Patreon</a>, which should be straightforward to use if you've already set up an account.</li>
    <li><a href="https://liberapay.com/nebula">Liberapay</a>, which is a considerably more reliable platform than Patreon, but might take some setup to get working.</li>
</ul>
<p>As additional thanks for donating CA$5 or more a month, we have a shiny <i style="color: #f1c40f">Supporter</i> role on <a href="discord/">the Discord server</a>! Patreon should give this to you automatically... but it's still a little experimental, so let us know if it doesn't, or if you're donating from Liberapay.</p>
