<h3>site changes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>redesigned the homepage from the ground up to be a better landing page for the wiki! <ul>
        <li>three groupings for the wiki index: New Releases, Fandom, Official, showing just a few so it's easy to navigate, with new buttons to view a complete grid listing</li>
        <li>moved the "Explore the site!" links over to the newly wiki-wide header, placing albums front and center while leaving navigation links readily accessible</li>
        <li>added a sidebar to the homepage, listing recent <a href="news/">news entries</a> parallel with albums</li>

    </ul></li>
    <li>improved navigation all around the site, making the wiki as a whole more consistent</li>

</ul>
<h3>track pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>previously, all tracks required a URL to be added to the wiki; now, for tracks which don't have any links to be listened at online (but are still referenced by other tracks), they have been added alongside a message saying there aren't any listening links</li>
    <li>as such, another full pass through <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html">NSND</a> has been completed, and many tracks which weren't present on the wiki before have been added to the newly reorganized [[album:Unreleased Tracks]] album!</li>

</ul>
<h3>miscellaneous</h3>

    <li>the header has links to the previous and next (or random) track/flash, and chronology links have been moved into the header too, so you don't need to scroll to the bottom of the page to access them</li>
    <li>on top of redoing the sidebar-header layout, changes to styling (collapsing the sidebar when the screen isn't very wide, for example) have made the site usable on mobile devices now!</li>
    <li>also, some changes to the way pages are generated, to make the site usable from hit command-line web browser <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a></li>

    <li>two new listings: <a href="list/tracks/by-times-referenced/">Tracks - by Times Referenced</a> and <a href="list/random/">Random Pages</a></li>
    <li>if you're bored and don't know here to start exploring, the Random Pages listing has a bunch of links that will decide for you! (it does require JavaScript, though)</li>
</ul>
<h3>album/track pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>these got their share of randomness too, in the form of a new "Random Track" link at the bottom of the sidebar</li>
    <li>cover art can now have a distinct release date from the album, which is the case for anthology projects that organize art for an album after it has been released</li>
</ul>
<h3>artist pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>track credit listings already showed collaborators in contribution lines; now cover art credits do too, e.g. the page for <a href="artist/mika-b/">Mika B.</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
    <li>the <a href="https://sollay-b.tumblr.com/post/188094230423/hello-a-couple-of-years-ago-allyssinian">Homestuck Vol. 5 Anthology</a> has been mirrored in the [[album:Homestuck Vol. 5]] album page</li>
    <li>a new feature acknowledgements section has been added to the <a href="about/">About &amp; Credits</a> page</li>
    <li>a bunch of code changes to make expanding the wiki a fair bit less difficult</li>
</ul>

<h3>homepage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>the homepage is now split into two sections: "Fandom" and "Official"</li>
    <li>only one fandom album now, [[album:Diverging Delicacies]], but more to come soon</li>
    <li>the official album grid listing was changed to sort the newest releases closest to the top of the page, as bandcamp orders releases, to keep consistent with the fandom grid listing (where we want new releases to stand out right away)</li>
</ul>
<h3>track pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>the "tracks that referenced" list is now grouped into two sections: official and fandom</li>
</ul>
<h3>flashes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>a CSS change targeting the homepage inadvertently made the headings on the flash index look very fancy, and i kept this because it looks cool</li>
</ul>

    <li>each flash gets its own unique thumbnail (except A6I4 flashes, please forgive me troll clown jegus)</li>
    <li>every flash page has a link to play the flash on homestuck.com, its page number, release date, and a list of the tracks featured in it</li>
    <li>the code to generate sidebar was absolute hell to write</li>
    <li><a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/19708732/chapters/46642894">jadevris</a></li>

    <li>added a new "Explore the site!" box on the homepage, linking to the about page as well as the new <a href="list/">listings index</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>listings</h3>
<ul>
    <li>completely new pages for exploring the wiki in completely new ways; they serve as an alternative to writing a dynamic search engine, because github doesn't let us write a custom backend and client-side javascript sucks</li>
    <li>all linked from <a href="list/">listings index</a>, accessible through the sidebar</li>
    <li>there are nine of these but if you doubt i'm going to list them all, you're wrong</li>
    <li><a href="list/albums/by-name/">Albums - by Name:</a> every album, sorted alphabetically</li>
    <li><a href="list/albums/by-date/">Albums - by Date:</a> every album, sorted chronologically (at the time this was no different than the homepage grid listing's sort, but today it contains fandom albums interweaved with official ones)</li>
    <li><a href="list/albums/by-tracks/">Albums - by Tracks:</a> every album, sorted by number of tracks</li>
    <li><a href="list/artists/by-name/">Artists - by Name:</a> every artist, sorted by name (this also shows the number of contributions each artist has made next to their name)</li>
    <li><a href="list/artists/by-commentary/">Artists - by Commentary:</a> every artist, sorted by number of commentary entries</li>
    <li><a href="list/artists/by-contribs/">Artists - by Contributions:</a> every artist, sorted by number of contributions (times credited as a contributor, to music or art, on any track or album)</li>
    <li><a href="list/tracks/by-name/">Tracks - by Name:</a> every track, sorted alphabetically</li>
    <li><a href="list/tracks/by-album/">Tracks - by Album:</a> every track, grouped by album</li>
    <li><a href="list/tracks/by-date/">Tracks - by Date:</a> every track, grouped by release date</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="19-nov-19"><a href="#19-nov-19">19 November 2019 - grouped artist listings</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>artist page credit listings have been sigificantly restructured (<a href="media/misc/changelog/old-artist-page.png">before</a>, <a href="media/misc/changelog/new-artist-page.png">after</a>)</li>
    <li>contributions are now grouped by album (or more specifically, by release date, which is noteworthy in the case of [[album:Homestuck Vol. 1-4]], which was originally released over a period of four distinct dates, plus one for the final compiled album release)</li>
    <li>because it's easy to see where tracks are referenced now, dim contribution lines (showing tracks which reference a track by the specific artist, but were not otherwise contributed to by them) have been removed</li>
    <li>the lists aren't numbered anymore because, with this grouping, it was sort of ambiguous whether that referred to a track's position in the album or if it was a continuous counter of the artist's contributions (it was the latter); both such counters can now be displayed by holding still the cursor over a contribution line for a moment</li>
    <li>removed a few referenced-track contributions i'd missed switching to the new format (distinct reference lists) earlier</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="18-nov-19"><a href="#18-nov-19">18 November 2019 - high-res cover art</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>copied cover art from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dn2s69/i_was_prepared_for_this_eventuality_and_also/">this archive</a>, which was originally compiled by clicking each cover art off the bandcamp to get a higher-resolution cover art (it is intentionally still less than the resolution gotten in purchased album downloads, for particularly high-res art)</li>
    <li>commentary for [[album:Hiveswap Act 1 OST]]</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="16-nov-19" class="major-release"><a href="#16-nov-19">16 November 2019 - track references &amp; commentary</a></h2>
<h3>homepage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>got rid of the twitter link on my name and added two links in its place - my twitter and reddit accounts - as well as a note that suggestions and feedback are welcome</li>
</ul>
<h3>track pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>track references show up in a dedicated list now</li>
    <li>forward-facing reference links: track pages list not just the tracks they reference, but the tracks <i>which reference them</i></li>
    <li>reference data is from <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html"><dfn title="nobody knows what NSND stands for">NSND</dfn></a> (credited on the homepage)</li>
    <li>"listen on" links show up before the contributor list instead of after; reference list after contributor list</li>
    <li>at the very bottom, a new section for artist commentary, largely copied from <a href="https://pastebin.com/gqpHsKkE">this pastebin</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>artist pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>added a message describing dim contribution lines: "Dim tracks are tracks that this artist contributed only a based-upon song to."</li>
    <li>for tracks with multiple contributors, those are listed as well, e.g. "(with Michael Guy Bowman)"</li>
    <li>note that this doesn't include "contributors" who only provided a referenced track, since those are now stored in a list separate from the contributors list</li>
    <li>a new section for commentary</li>
    <li>a "jump to" paragraph at the top, to quickly scroll to any of the track/art/commentary sections</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="major-release" id="15-nov-19"><a href="#15-nov-19">15 November 2019 - initial release</a></h2>
<h3>initial release of the website</h3>
<ul>
    <li>published <a href="https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic.github.io/">on github</a> with code under the GPL; hosted on hsmusic.github.io</li>
    <li>advertised exclusively <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dwtc4w/i_made_a_wiki_for_homestuck_albums_including/">on reddit</a></li>
    <li>(and maybe twitter but my account has long been deleted)</li>
</ul>
<h3>homepage</h3>
<ul>
    <li>an intro message which has since been moved to <a href="about/">About &amp; Credits</a></li>
    <li>a grid listing for the albums: all official releases, from [[album:Midnight Crew: Drawing Dead]] through [[album:Hiveswap Friendsim]]</li>
</ul>
<h3>album pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>album name, release date, track listing, cover art &amp; art credits</li>
    <li>solo albums also show their artist</li>
</ul>
<h3>track pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>track name, release date, artists (musicians), cover art &amp; art credits</li>
    <li>links to listen to the track too (and code to convert URLs into human-readable site names, e.g. "YouTube" or "Bandcamp" or "(External)")</li>
    <li>rudimentary leitmotif reference credits in the form of "Contributors" list</li>
    <li>contributors list also contains credited collaborators on the track, e.g. producers, vocalists</li>
</ul>
<h3>artist pages</h3>
<ul>
    <li>name, track and art credits</li>
    <li>artist pages look quite different from today but serve the same purpose of listing their contributions</li>
    <li><a href="changelog-misc/old-artist-page.png">here's an example</a></li>
    <li>credits are all in one numbered list; most are just the name of the track contributed to and the album it's from</li>
    <li>for tracks where an artist made a specific contribution, that's mentioned too, e.g. "Sburban Countdown (arrangement)"</li>
    <li>if a musician's contribution is simply a track which was referenced, the line for that contribution is slightly dim (it still contributes to the counter)</li>
</ul>
