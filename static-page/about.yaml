    Welcome to HSMusic, a fan-made Homestuck music wiki!
    <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">Homestuck</a> has always been an incredible creative collaboration, and especially beloved by the community—not to mention a crucial part of that collaboration—is Homestuck's humongous soundtrack, comprising well over 500 diverse tracks by dozens of musicians and artists. This wiki aims to be an interesting and useful resource for anyone interested in that music, as well as an archive and up-to-date reference for all things related.
    On the history of this site: it was originally created  as a remake of Homestuck's official <a href="https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/">Bandcamp</a>, which saw its content particularly restructured on 25 October 2019. HSMusic Wiki aims to be a longer-lasting resource and reference: track art is archived for good, solo albums (and beyond!) are all catalogued in one place, and URLs will always stay consistent. And of course, nearly every track and album has links for listening on Bandcamp and other services.
    Nowadays, HSMusic also operates as a center for all sorts of fan music, a starting point where avid listeners can explore, discover, and support artists and albums within the sphere around Homestuck music. We're always looking to share new music here, so if there's anything you'd like to see, please feel encouraged to [[static:feedback|drop a line]]! We also have an active [[static:discord|Discord community]] where a wide variety of folk discuss Homestuck music and work together to bring updates, new albums, and more to the HSMusic website - anyone is welcome to drop by and say hello!
    The code for this website is open source (MIT license), and can be explored or forked <a href="https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic-wiki/">on GitHub</a>. If you want to get in touch with feature requests, comments on the code, or pesky bugs which passed through unnoticed, feel free to open an issue or contact through [[static:discord|Discord]] or [[static:feedback|other means]]!
