    <strong>Feature requests?<br>Noticed any errors?<br>Itching to see that one album you love on the wiki?</strong>
    Please let us know! We appreciate feedback a lot, and always want to make this site better.
    There are five main channels you can reach the dev through:
    - [[static:discord|HSMusic Community Discord Server]] - The official Discord, and a friendly place to drop feedback or discuss the wiki. (We also share sneak peeks of the coming updates here frequently!)
    - <a href="https://forum.homestuck.xyz/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=151">HomestuckXYZ</a> - A public forum thread for the wiki.
    - <a href="https://twitter.com/sapphicGnostic">Twitter</a> - DMs for discussion or feedback are open! (It might go a while unnoticed, though - the site only indicates message requests when it's manually checked, and we're pretty terrible at remembering to do that!)
    - <a href="https://types.pl/@quasar">Mastodon</a> - Same as birdsite but a moderately less terrible platform :)
    - Email - it's <s><code>towerofnix at gmail dot beans</code></s> <b>now been revised</b> to <code>qznebula at protonmail dot com</code>! (We'll still get messages at the old address, though.) Old-fashioned, but personally our favorite besides the Discord, and certainly practical if you're sending a longer-form message.
    Thanks so much for sharing your feedback!
