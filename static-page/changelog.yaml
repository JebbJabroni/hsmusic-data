    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - (nebula writes about all the site changes here)
    - new Additional Files feature added, including downloadable album booklets and other goodies, present across many official albums: [[album:homestuck-vol-4]], [[album:homestuck-vol-5]], [[album:alternia]], [[album:squiddles]], [[album:strife]], [[album:alterniabound]], [[album:homestuck-vol-7]], [[album:mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido]], [[album:sburb]], [[album:the-wanderers]], [[album:homestuck-vol-8]], [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]], [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-b]], [[album:homestuck-vol-9]], [[album:one-year-older]], [[album:cherubim]], and [[album:homestuck-vol-10]]
        - includes all booklets and resources released with official albums that aren't included in downloads from the recent (2019) official Homestuck Bandcamp restructure
        - files from solo re-releases are included and shared publicly on the wiki with permission from their original artists
        - includes unedited versions of Bandcamp banners and backgrounds used throughout the wiki
    - [[album:unreleased-tracks]] has been completely reorganized, with many tracks having been moved to new organizational albums [[album:more-homestuck-fandom]] and [[album:references-beyond-homestuck]], all collected under new [[group:additional-tracks]] group
    - "new" [[listing:albums/by-date-added|Albums - by Date Added]] listing, which has actually existed since [[news-entry:the-my-ex-wife-is-a-real-bitch-update|May 2021]], but was previously somehow at <a href="https://notabug.org/hsmusic/hsmusic-wiki/issues/53">a typo'd path</a> and wasn't accessible from the listing index
    - "Tracks that reference..." lists are now grouped by Beyond and Additional Tracks as well, instead of grouping everything that's not an official Homestuck track under Fandom
    - re-release tracks (such as [[track:black-vol-1-4]] from [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4]]) are no longer displayed in "Tracks that referenec" lists, and aren't counted in the [[listing:tracks/by-times-referenced|Tracks - by Times Referenced]] listing
    - colored track sections were removed from [[album:unreleased-tracks]] since it's been divided into [[group:additional-tracks|more specific albums anyway]], but they're now used in other areas of the site, including [[album:prospit-and-derse]] and [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4]]
    - though not all art has been ported yet, many albums and tracks (including most new ones) now have full resolution PNG artwork, accessible by clicking the cover art (thumbnails are still downscaled JPEGs to reduce data usage when generally browsing the wiki), as well as PNG banner and backgrounds where applicable
    - "short name" for the wiki changed has been chagned from "HSMusic" to "HSMusic Wiki" - this shows up in browser tab titles, the site navigation bar, and social embeds like Discord
    - slight tweaks to the appearance of album grids (as in group and tag galleries), most notably aligning tiles to the top of each row so that artwork always shows up in an even line
    - improvements to the way track artist strings are word wrapped, preventing pages from getting wider than they're supposed to be when a track has many artists (such as [[track:left-hand-remix]])
        - also fixed word wrapping on content pages with extremely long single words (like [[track:iiywaswiwtbotsa4aatwuotdtmihcimfh]]) when the screen is thinner than that word
    - internal support for albums which don't have cover art at all, as seen in new albums from [[group:additional-tracks]] and some releases from the community
    - new internal features which generalize hard-coded behavior for the Unreleased Tracks, letting new albums make use of some or all desired features:
        - internal support for albums which don't have release dates (these get sorted to the end on artist pages and are excluded from chronology links)
        - new "Has Track Numbers" field on albums which switches between the default <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and unordered <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> list displays for track lists
    <h3>albums</h3>

    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - updated CSS styling code to improve site layout on mobile devices
        - album/track cover art now displays at full width on thin screens, placing main page content beneath (with wider text area)
        - nav bar now displays as a single column of info rows on thin screens, rather than attempting to show track name and artist chronology links side-by-side
        - general CSS fixes should help with layout bugs
    <h3>album pages</h3>

    <h3>internal changes</h3>
    - divided much of 6000-line site generation file <code>upd8.js</code> into a number of smaller, better-organized files
    - separated each page generation function into its own module, reducing redundant maintenance, supporting future uses of these modules, and making the codebase a lot easier to navigate and build upon

    <h2 id="12-may-2021" class="major-release"><a href="#12-may-2021">[[date:12 May 2021]] - the my ex-wife is a real bitch update</a></h2>
    (news entry: [[news-entry:the-my-ex-wife-is-a-real-bitch-update]])
    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - a whole variety of updates and improvements to album sidebars:
        - got rid of the right-hand sidebar, as it was taking up considerable horizontal space; with the new free space, album and track art is featured at a much larger size, as originally intended (same for lyrics, commentary, etc!)
        - moved the group boxes that were on the right into the left-sidebar, above the track list on album pages and in a newly compressed view beneath the track list on track pages
        - made the track group headings collapsible/openable ("accordion" layout using <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> elements), so any track can easily be visited from any other track in the same album
        - made track groups default to all collapsed on the album page, since a view of all the track groups in full is visible in the main content area (as before), and the collapsed overview makes it easier to quickly jump to tracks in any section
        - much thanks to Niklink, for the general proposal of making more room for album art as well as miscellaneous feedback, and megatti, for suggesting the combined group view on track pages!
    - banner dimensions are now specified in album data files and included as part of HTML, keeping the layout on album pages with banners from flickering or shifting on slower connections
    - a bunch more internal changes:
        - began breaking the colossal single source file for the entire site build process into a number of more focused modules, making the codebase as a whole easier to work with; more work to be done here in the future
        - rewrote the entire inline parser and transformer for all text content on the site, using a new manual parsing method (rather than pure regexes) which supports nested tags but is still just as performant operating on huge amounts of data
            - this will basically enable support for more complex templating down the line, as well as accessing localization strings inside of content areas (like static pages, album commentary, artist contributions, and more)
        - JSON data files are now generated for albums and artists as well, although these aren't used anywhere on the site yet, and the data format is subject to change with more brainstorming
    <h3>albums</h3>
    - the new [[album:psycholonials]] full album release, as well as the new EPs leading up to it: [[album:psycholonials-ep-8]] and [[album:psycholonials-ep-9]]

    <h2 id="17-apr-2021"><a href="#17-apr-2021">[[date:17 April 2021]] - album links on tag pages fix</a></h2>
    <h3>bug fixes</h3>
    - fixed links to album cover art featuring characters on tag pages being broken (thanks, Megatti!)

    <h2 id="12-apr-2021" class="major-release"><a href="#12-apr-2021">[[date:12 April 2021]] - solo albums aplenty</a></h2>
    (news entry: [[news-entry:solo-albums-aplenty]])
    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - added per-album banners, as a compliment to wallpapers (from February)
        - currently only show up on album index pages, not track pages, since they can push the content pretty far down
        - thanks to Niklink for helping archive and double-check these!
    - made background for the content area a glossy, rather than solid, gray; particularly notable on albums with custom wallpapers
    - removed <i>Psycholonials</i> row from homepage and replaced New Releases with New Additions, a new type of row showing a diverse selection of the latest albums to be added to the wiki
    - added data files for tracks, accessible at <code>/data/track/&lt;directory&gt;/data.json</code> ("directory" means the name of the track as it shows up in permalink URLs, e.g. <code>bl1nd-just1c3-1nv3st1g4t1on</code>)
        - will be extended to albums, artists, etc soon!
        - can be accessed from external programs via HTTP request
        - will probably also exist as a complete package download for offline use, though this hasn't been done yet
    - internal changes as foundations for future updates
        - tweaks and improvements to the CLI site build tool
        - made the URL/path system generally less complex (and accidentally spent way too long on this!)
        - more translation additions and brainstorming for how to work them into more of the site
        - implemented the basic design and functionality for info (hover) cards, which are functional but not quite complete and will show up in a release soon
            - you can try them out by setting <code>localStorage.tryInfoCards = true</code> in your browser console!
            - only implemented for tracks so far; make use of the data files described above
    <h3>albums</h3>
    - another lovely selection of albums, all from solo artists, summarized below
    - from [[group:cristata]]:

        - fixed [[track:your-universe]] being credited to "Marcus Citrine" rather than [[artist:marcus-carline]] (who also wrote [[track:the-leaving]] from [[album:beyond-canon]]!)

        - (all artworks above were previously credited to the catch-all [[artist:homestuck]])
    <h3>bug fixes</h3>
    - fixed artist pages no longer sorting tracks according to their original release date (e.g. on [[artist:nuclear333]], tracks from [[album:inhospitable-delisted]] were being sorted according to the album rerelease in 2021, rather than the original track releases in 2017)
    - fixed sidebar of [[album:unreleased-tracks]] all being one color, instead of applying distinguishing colors for each track group (thanks, foreverFlummoxed!)
    - fixed a few dates at the end of the changelog being formatted inconsistently with the rest of the wiki

    <h2 id="16-mar-2021"><a href="#16-mar-2021">[[date:16 March 2021]] - "random" link fixes</a></h2>
    <h3>bug fixes</h3>
    - fixed "random" links (e.g. on album pages and [[listing:random|Random Pages]] listing) redirecting to "undefined" URLs instead of the appropriate type directory (track, group, etc)

    <h2 id="12-mar-2021" class="major-release"><a href="#12-mar-2021">[[date:12 March 2021]] - translation &amp; renovation</a></h2>
    (news entry: [[news-entry:translation-renovation]])
    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - translation/localization support:
        - nearly all static text on the wiki has been replaced with strings specified in a plain JSON file
        - default language for a wiki is generated at the root directory (/) as usual; new languages are in subdirectory (e.g. "/jp/album/diverging-delicacies")
        - no languages are newly supported yet, but the localization system is totally tested; see [[news-entry:translation-renovation|the news entry]] for details on contributing translations!
    - thumbnail support:
        - small images (250x250) are used in grids (on homepage, album/artist galleries, etc)
        - medium images (400x400) are used on pages with larger cover art (individual track/album pages, etc)
        - full-size images (usually 600x600-1200x1200, pulled from public bandcamp listings) are no longer embedded at all, but can still be viewed by clicking on cover arts to zoom in
        - previously, <em>every</em> image on the site was full-size! this was particularly terrible for people with slow connections or limited bandwidths
        - example stats: download size of scrolling entire homepage reduced from 3.8mb to 0.6mb
    - internal renovation across build file:
        - (<a href="https://youtu.be/6G6_vo50OBo">before</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/1dqP4Vrjp3c">after</a>)
        - url system restructured:
            - link-related bugs are much harder to run into
            - link references in content (e.g. "\[[album:foo-bar]]") are modularized and can more easily link to anywhere across the wiki
            - codebase forks can easily adjust url specification to move parts of the site to different paths (though this isn't yet possible via data file)
            - site build time is significantly reduced (since there are far fewer redundant calls to path.relative)
        - page write functions restructured
            - data required during a page write is gathered once, and then reused across all languages that page is built in, significantly reducing build time across multiple languages
            - writePage itself is broken into a few different chunks, which can be referenced individually when needed
            - changes tie nicely into url system restructure as well
        - shared data variables and functions organized and tidied for simpler access across code
        - miscellaneous arguments and specifications across code have been restructured to prefer explicit description before unnecessarily compact formats
            - this has the side-effect of making a fair amount of the build logic simpler!
        - significantly expanded data validation which happens before any site pages are written
    <h3>albums</h3>
    - besides additions for [[group:psycholonials]], no new music shared on the wiki this month, as translation and renovation changes took an especially long time to design and implement
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - added total duration of music contributed to an album next ot the album date
    - display "cover art" and "wallpaper art" lines at the top of an album art contribution list, rather than at the bottom (this had been an accidental code error)
    - display flash/game date range next to the "act" (or flash group label), rather than showing every date next to each flash, to make this section much visually cleaner
    - removed "Featured in" links, since these were taking up a lot of visual space
        - this has been added to [[listing:tracks/in-flashes/by-album|Tracks - in Flashes &amp; Games (by Album)]] instead
    <h3>commentary pages</h3>
    - cleaned [[commentary-index:_|commentary index]] layout and strings (e.g. before: "19/20 entries; 8.4k words", after: "8.4k words across 19 entries")
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - reference list is only divided into "fandom" and "official" if a group with directory "official" is present in the first place
        - this is essentially hard-coded, but is a quick and simple fix for all references on wikis without the concept displaying as "fandom" references
    <h3>listings</h3>
    - generally tweaked strings to be more consistent across listings and the site
    - added gallery link to [[listing:groups/by-name|Groups - by Name]] and [[listing:groups/by-category|Groups - by Category]] listings
    - added flash links to [[listing:tracks/in-flashes/by-album|Tracks - in Flashes &amp; Games (by Album)]]
    - added album links to [[listing:tracks/in-flashes/by-flash|Tracks - in Flashes &amp; Games (by Flash)]]
    - added number of uses to [[listing:tags/by-name|Tags - by Name]]
    - implemented [[listing:random|Random Pages]] as an actual listing via the same system as all others
        - this is just generally better practice
        - it also fixes the Random Pages link not being bold when selected though!
    <h3>data changes</h3>
    - dozens of internal changes using new link syntax, as well as other internal fixes without user-visible changes
    - contributor list changes for consistency across wiki and to remove redundant credit info:
        - [[track:showtime-piano-refrain]]:
            - credit [[artist:kevin-regamey]] only as artist, not contributor

            - place [[artist:buzinkai]] before [[artist:toby-fox]] (but leave toby in the artist list)
        - [[track:solar-voyage]]: credit [[artist:marcy-nabors]] for composition as well as arrangement and vocals (and move to top of list)
        - [[track:renewed-return]]: credit [[artist:marcy-nabors]] for composition as well as bass clarinet (and move to top of list)

        - [[track:violet-and-gold]]: credit [[artist:veritas-unae]] for composition as well as lyrics (and move to top of list)

        - renamed [[track:wisest-wizord]] (used to be "Wizest Wizord")
        - renamed [[track:revisit-rewind]] (used to have spaces around slash)

    - clarified wallpaper contributions that said "edits" (e.g. [[album:homestuck-vol-5]]) to say "edits for wiki"
    - album and flash data additions for [[group:psycholonials]] over the course of the month

    <h2 id="12-feb-2021" class="major-release"><a href="#12-feb-2021">[[date:12 February 2021]] - retrace, retexture</a></h2>
    (news entry: [[news-entry:retrace-retexture]])
    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - added per-album wallpapers
        - many albums have these, e.g. [[album:homestuck-vol-5]]; check "data changes" section for full list
        - archive and restore the original presentation of album releases while still keeping a unified design across the whole wiki
        - much thanks to [[artist:niklink]] for help collecting and editing these, as well as originally suggesting this feature in December; as well as to the rest of the [[static:discord|Discord]] community for suggestions and feedback!
    - added per-album commentary pages
        - no-distraction, complete collections of all commentary for each album, divided by track
        - based upon and replaces the old "All Commentary" listing, which was always too long for its own good
        - e.g. [[album-commentary:genesis-frog]], [[album-commentary:lofam4]]
    - added distinct news entry pages
        - much like "All Commentary", a solitary news page would quickly become unwieldy for most browsers!
        - [[site:news/|news index]] now shows headings and short passages instead
    - added footer to all pages of the site
        - contains feedback and donate links for now; this is totally customizable (see below!)
    - added <i>Psycholonials</i> row to homepage
        - will be updated as new chapters are released, in independent updates from the main coming March/April releases
        - no information for tracks currently unreleased, but we'll revisit this when all chapters and the full soundtrack have been released
    - many, many internal changes
        - almost all content across the wiki is now totally dynamic; e.g, wiki name and color scheme are stored in a data file
        - static pages like Changelog and Donate are no longer hard-coded and can be added or removed without editing the wiki code
        - homepage rows can also be customized; while there's only one type of row available currently (albums from list or group and optionally action links), the foundations are there to add more in the future
        - most site features, e.g. [[site:flash/|Flashes &amp; Games]], [[listing-index:_|Listings]], and [[news-index:_|News]], can now be selectively enabled and disabled
        - a variety of changes to the internal text transformer, making longform text in data files (e.g. commentary, lyrics, static pages) much easier to read and write
        - <a href="https://git.ed1.club/nebula/hsmusic-wiki/">code</a> and <a href="https://git.ed1.club/nebula/hsmusic-data/">data</a> repositories have been separated (media as well, but it's not pushed online anywhere yet); CLI tool for actually building the site has been updated accordingly
        - all these changes are in service of making running your own wiki off the same codebase accessible and powerful; there's still much to be done before it's totally ready, though

    <h3>groups</h3>
    - new feature! groups are collections of fan albums, organized under a dedicated page for an external group or project.
    - groups exist in three categories: <i>HSMusic</i>, <i>Fan-musician groups</i>, and <i>Projects beyond Homestuck</i>
        - HSMusic: overall structure for the wiki, containing [[group:official]] and [[group:fandom]], into which nearly all albums are categorized
        - Fan-musician groups: collaborative groups of fan-musicians releasing music under a single name, e.g. [[group:casual-sunday]] and [[group:unofficial-mspa-fans]]
        - Projects beyond Homestuck: groups centered around a particular work, usually inspired by Homestuck, e.g. [[group:undertale-and-deltarune]] and [[group:oceanfalls]]
    - groups each have two "tabs" or views: Info and Gallery
        - Info: this displays the full description for a group, and then a chronological list of albums (and their years of release)
        - Gallery: replacing the previously dedicated pages for official and fandom albums, this displays a list of albums organized with their latest first, and has a short info line summarizing stats about the group
    - miniature group "infoboxes" are displayed on the right side of album and track pages
        - this design (alongside much of this update's layout changes) is inspired by the site layout of Bandcamp
        - contains a short catchline introducing the group, links to visit the external homes of the group (e.g. its own Bandcamp or project links), and chronology links to navigate the previous and next albums within the group
        - displayed at the bottom of the page in compact layout (e.g. when on a mobile device)
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - every artist who has contributed track or album cover art, e.g. [[artist:elanor-pam]], now has a gallery page; these are much the same as tag gallery pages but for artists
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - YouTube links for individual tracks no longer attach their playlist, because this was deemed Mostly Just Impractical in discussion
    <h3>listings</h3>
    - added six new listings, for the new groups feature:
        - [[listing:groups/by-name|Groups - by Name]]
        - [[listing:groups/by-category|Groups - by Category]]

    - adjusted the order of existing listings, to make them hopefully a little easier to navigate
    - renamed the "Tracks - in Flashes &amp; Games (by First Feature)" listing to "... (by Flash)" and [[site:list/tracks/in-flashes/by-flash/|considerably restructured it]], effectively making it into a compact summary of the [[site:flash/|Flashes &amp; Games]] portion of the site

        - removed "Loading..." easter egg from [[flash:5426]], but not before <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210111224459/https://hsmusic.wiki/flash/5426/">archiving it</a> for you, personally

    <h2 id="12-dec-2020" class="major-release"><a href="#12-dec-2020">[[date:12 December 2020]] - launch of hsmusic.wiki</a></h2>
    (news entry: [[news-entry:hsmusicwiki]])
    <h3>site changes</h3>
    - redesigned the homepage from the ground up to be a better landing page for the wiki!
        - three groupings for the wiki index: New Releases, Fandom, Official, showing just a few so it's easy to navigate, with new buttons to view a complete grid listing
        - moved the "Explore the site!" links over to the newly wiki-wide header, placing albums front and center while leaving navigation links readily accessible
        - added a sidebar to the homepage, listing recent [[site:news/|news entries]] parallel with albums
    - improved navigation all around the site, making the wiki as a whole more consistent
        - cover art displayed in grid items is smaller across the site, fitting more items on a screen at once and emphasizing the name more than before
        - on the new [[root:albums/official/|Official]] and [[root:albums/fandom/|Fandom]] album indexes, the number of tracks and length of the album is displayed as well
    - added lazy loading for images, so landing pages shouldn't take up nearly as much data, and will load quicker (especially noticeable for the [[site:flash/|Flashes &amp; Games]] index!)
    - adjusted the styling for grouped listings (previously used only for [[album:unreleased-tracks]]) as they become more common (see data changes section)
    - made links which require JavaScript only show up if JS is actually enabled
    <h3>tags</h3>
    - new feature! tags are used for two things: categorizing track art by character, and displaying content warnings.
    - added a tag list beneath most track and album arts describing characters in the image and linking to their gallery pages
    - added tag gallery pages under the Listings section, showing a grid of all the track and album covers which are tagged with that character
    - added content warnings for common triggers (alcohol, body horror, etc), blurring out the image and showing warning tags until it is clicked and revealed
    <h3>listings</h3>
    - some extra wiki-wide stats are displayed on the [[site:list/|Listings index]]!
    - divided the [[site:list/artists/by-contribs/|Artists - by Contributions]] and [[site:list/artists/by-latest/|Artists - by Latest Contribution]] listings into two columns for easier exploring: "Track Contributors" and "Track &amp; Flash Contributors"
    - added two new listings, for the new tags feature:
        - [[site:list/tags/by-name|Tags - by Name]]
        - [[site:list/tags/by-uses|Tags - by Uses]]
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - made the index of the current track show next to the track name in the navbar
    - made the start and end indexes of each group show next to group names in the sidebar
    - divided the sidebar into groups for a bunch of albums (see data changes section)
    <h3>bug fixes</h3>
    - fixed a bug where chronology links (e.g "413th track by Toby Fox") for track artists weren't being displayed anymore
    - fixed a bug where artists with zero contributions (e.g. only commentary) would display as "( c.)" instead of "(0 c.)" in artist listings
    - fixed a bug where flash names would <i>always</i> have the dot at the end of the name removed, instead of only when punctuation follows
    - fixed some bugs with release date code where the [[site:list/artists/by-latest/|Artists - by Latest]] listing would not count unique dates of cover art contributions (e.g. in anthology projects where fanart is added after the release of the album), and where the cover art release date displayed on album pages was ambiguous (previously it displayed the date of track art for the whole album; now it displays - or, if it is the same as album release, does not display - the date of cover art for the album itself)
    - fixed a bug on artist pages where tracks that are featured in more than one flash would display flashes past the first feature as "1", "2", "3", etc, instead of the actual flash names
    - fixed a bug on artist pages where co-artists of tracks (but not track art) weren't being displayed anymore
    - fixed a bug where the random official album link in the [[site:list/random/|Random Pages]] listing would instead open a random track across the whole site
    - made all the links on the [[site:list/random/|Random Pages]] listing behave more like regular links (ctrl-click works for example)

    <h3>homepage</h3>
    - a new [[static:changelog|Changelog]] page! you are probably reading it now.
    - two new albums: [[album:rust-apocalypse]] by Willow Ascenzo, and the follow-up to [[album:beforus]], [[album:ancestral]]!
    <h3>flash pages</h3>
    - flash pages now have links at which they can be listened, besides just on homestuck.com! most importantly: links to HD recordings, so they can be watched at good resolution on any device
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - previously, all tracks required a URL to be added to the wiki; now, for tracks which don't have any links to be listened at online (but are still referenced by other tracks), they have been added alongside a message saying there aren't any listening links
    - as such, another full pass through <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html">NSND</a> has been completed, and many tracks which weren't present on the wiki before have been added to the newly reorganized [[album:unreleased-tracks]] album!
    <h3>listings</h3>
    - the [[site:list/all-commentary/|All Commentary]] listing page has been tweaked so that links in commentary will follow the color of the album the commentary is from
    - the [[site:list/|listing index]] shows its list in the main content area now too, for when the sidebar is collapsed (see below!)
    <h3>miscellaneous</h3>
    - a new navigation header added to every album, track, flash, and listing page, making the site considerably more usable on any device
    - the header has links to the previous and next (or random) track/flash, and chronology links have been moved into the header too, so you don't need to scroll to the bottom of the page to access them
    - on top of redoing the sidebar-header layout, changes to styling (collapsing the sidebar when the screen isn't very wide, for example) have made the site usable on mobile devices now!
    - also, some changes to the way pages are generated, to make the site usable from hit command-line web browser <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</a>

    <h2 id="2-jun-20"><a href="#2-jun-20">[[date:2 June 2020]] - track art for beyond canon</h2>
    - thanks to the folx who contributed art to and organized the <a href="https://hsfanmusic.skaia.net/post/619761136023257089/unofficialmspafans-we-are-proud-to-announce-the">Beyond Canon Track Art Anthology</a>, the [[album:beyond-canon]] album now has track art!
    - this anthology also came with a commentary booklet, and that (alongside the sketches contained!) has been transcribed into the wiki!

    <h2 id="25-may-20" class="major-release"><a href="#25-may-20">[[date:25 May 2020]] - albums, artists, and urls</a></h2>
    <h3>homepage</h3>
    - another four new fandom albums! [[album:sburb-ost]], [[album:beforus]], [[album:strife-2]], [[album:perfectly-generic-album]]
    - the entire homepage has been restructured, placing official albums from the music team for <i>Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon</i> front and center, and generally adding flare to the rest of the page too
    - a &lt;meta&gt; tag has been added to the homepage, so hsmusic's search result that comes up when you look up "homestuck music wiki" is a lot prettier
    <h3>album pages</h3>
    - links to listen to the full album have <i>finally</i> been added to album pages, including bandcamp as well as youtube links (both full album and playlist) wherever available
    - chronology links now contain credits for cover artists, so they'll show up on album pages too
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - chronology links for contributors to tracks as well as the main musicians! check out [[You Killed My Father (Prepare To Die)]] by team dogfight, for example
    <h3>flash pages</h3>
    - chronology links have been added to flash pages too!
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - artist pages - both musicians and cover artists - now have links to explore their work outside of homestuck
    - many, many artists whose names are either typo'd or out of date or otherwise duplicate have been updated, making artist pages a considerably more reliable resource than they were before
    - behind the scenes, lots of code changes to make accidentally typo'd or duplicate artist names much more difficult

    <h2 id="15-apr-20"><a href="#15-apr-20">[[date:15 April 2020]] - chronology links</a></h2>
    - "chronology links" have been added to the bottom of the sidebar on track pages

    <h2 id="18-mar-20"><a href="#18-mar-20">[[date:18 March 2020]] - more sburb commentary</a></h2>
    - the [[album:sburb]] solo album was rereleased by its artist, so Bandcamp links have been copied to its track pages, as have the new commentary released with it

    <h2 id="16-mar-20" class="major-release"><a href="#16-mar-20">[[date:16 March 2020]] - Land of Fans and Music <small>(and References and Randomness and Art and Also Some Other Stuff)</small></a></h2>

    - (the commentary booklets transcribed here are hilarious and very insightful and there are a bunch of easter eggs - check them out!)
    - another new "album", [[album:unreleased-tracks]], containing tracks which were never released but were either referenced in released tracks or included in flash animations
    - the text of the link to the feedback page has been changed from "Feedback" to "Feedback &amp; Suggestions"
    <h3>listings</h3>
    - two new listings: [[site:list/tracks/by-times-referenced/|Tracks - by Times Referenced]] and [[site:list/random/|Random Pages]]
    - if you're bored and don't know here to start exploring, the Random Pages listing has a bunch of links that will decide for you! (it does require JavaScript, though)
    <h3>album/track pages</h3>
    - these got their share of randomness too, in the form of a new "Random Track" link at the bottom of the sidebar
    - cover art can now have a distinct release date from the album, which is the case for anthology projects that organize art for an album after it has been released
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - track credit listings already showed collaborators in contribution lines; now cover art credits do too, e.g. the page for [[artist:mika-b]].</a>
    <h3>miscellaneous</h3>
    - the <a href="https://sollay-b.tumblr.com/post/188094230423/hello-a-couple-of-years-ago-allyssinian">Homestuck Vol. 5 Anthology</a> has been mirrored in the [[album:homestuck-vol-5]] album page
    - a new feature acknowledgements section has been added to the [[static:about|About &amp; Credits]] page
    - a bunch of code changes to make expanding the wiki a fair bit less difficult

    <h2 id="1-mar-20" class="major-release"><a href="#1-mar-20">[[date:1 March 2020]] - embracing fanon</a></h2>
    <h3>homepage</h3>
    - the homepage is now split into two sections: "Fandom" and "Official"
    - only one fandom album now, [[album:diverging-delicacies]], but more to come soon
    - the official album grid listing was changed to sort the newest releases closest to the top of the page, as bandcamp orders releases, to keep consistent with the fandom grid listing (where we want new releases to stand out right away)
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - the "tracks that referenced" list is now grouped into two sections: official and fandom
    <h3>flashes</h3>
    - a CSS change targeting the homepage inadvertently made the headings on the flash index look very fancy, and i kept this because it looks cool

    <h2 id="7-feb-20" class="major-release"><a href="#7-feb-20">[[date:7 February 2020]] - flash pages</a></h2>
    <h3>homepage</h3>
    - link to the new [[site:flash/|Flashes]] index page
    <h3>flash pages</h3>
    - an individual page for each flash, and a new grid-style index (like the homepage) to collect them all, grouped by act
    - each flash gets its own unique thumbnail (except A6I4 flashes, please forgive me troll clown jegus)
    - every flash page has a link to play the flash on homestuck.com, its page number, release date, and a list of the tracks featured in it
    - the code to generate sidebar was absolute hell to write
    - <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/19708732/chapters/46642894">jadevris</a>
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - a track's page will list the flashes in which it's been referenced, e.g. [[Elevatorstuck]]
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - within the list of tracks an artist has contributed music to, if that track has been featured in any flashes, those will be listed on the track's contribution line
    <h3>miscellaneous</h3>
    - switched a couple artist names around, for consistency with credits in the latest release ([[album:homestuck-vol-10]])</a>
    - added a new [[static:feedback|Feedback]] page, with links to contact me; this is also linked from the homepage

    <h2 id="14-jan-20"><a href="#14-jan-20">[[date:14 January 2020]] - commentary for Sburb</a></h2>
    - copied commentary for the [[album:sburb]] album, per descriptions of the YouTube videos

    <h2 id="6-dec-19"><a href="#6-dec-19">[[date:6 December 2019]] - commentary for [S] Collide.</a></h2>
    - copied commentary from James Roach on twitter about his contributions to the [[album:s-collide]] album

    <h2 id="3-dec-19"><a href="#3-dec-19">[[date:3 December 2019]] - commentary &amp; lyrics</a></h2>
    - copied over official commentary booklets for three official albums - [[album:alterniabound]], [[album:one-year-older]], [[album:homestuck-vol-10]] - beginning a long tale of booklet transcription going forward
    - added a new section to track pages for lyrics, e.g. on [[Temporal Shenanigans]]
    - added two new listing pages: [[site:list/tracks/with-lyrics/|Tracks - with Lyrics]] and [[site:list/all-commentary/|All Commentary]]

    <h2 id="24-nov-19" class="major-release"><a href="#24-nov-19">[[date:24 November 2019]] - so many new pages</a></h2>
    <h3>homepage / "About &amp; Credits"</h3>
    - moved the intro message to a new [[static:about|About &amp; Credits]] page
    - structured the site credits list more nicely there
    - added a new "Explore the site!" box on the homepage, linking to the about page as well as the new [[site:list/|listings index]]
    <h3>listings</h3>
    - completely new pages for exploring the wiki in completely new ways; they serve as an alternative to writing a dynamic search engine, because github doesn't let us write a custom backend and client-side javascript sucks
    - all linked from [[site:list/|listings index]], accessible through the sidebar
    - there are nine of these but if you doubt i'm going to list them all, you're wrong
    - [[site:list/albums/by-name/|Albums - by Name]]: every album, sorted alphabetically
    - [[site:list/albums/by-date/|Albums - by Date]]: every album, sorted chronologically (at the time this was no different than the homepage grid listing's sort, but today it contains fandom albums interweaved with official ones)
    - [[site:list/albums/by-tracks/|Albums - by Tracks]]: every album, sorted by number of tracks
    - [[site:list/artists/by-name/|Artists - by Name]]: every artist, sorted by name (this also shows the number of contributions each artist has made next to their name)
    - [[site:list/artists/by-commentary/|Artists - by Commentary]]: every artist, sorted by number of commentary entries
    - [[site:list/artists/by-contribs/|Artists - by Contributions]]: every artist, sorted by number of contributions (times credited as a contributor, to music or art, on any track or album)
    - [[site:list/tracks/by-name/|Tracks - by Name]]: every track, sorted alphabetically
    - [[site:list/tracks/by-album/|Tracks - by Album]]: every track, grouped by album
    - [[site:list/tracks/by-date/|Tracks - by Date]]: every track, grouped by release date

    <h2 id="19-nov-19"><a href="#19-nov-19">[[date:19 November 2019]] - grouped artist listings</a></h2>
    - artist page credit listings have been sigificantly restructured ([[root:media/misc/changelog/old-artist-page.png|before]], [[root:media/misc/changelog/new-artist-page.png|after]])
    - contributions are now grouped by album (or more specifically, by release date, which is noteworthy in the case of [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4]], which was originally released over a period of four distinct dates, plus one for the final compiled album release)
    - because it's easy to see where tracks are referenced now, dim contribution lines (showing tracks which reference a track by the specific artist, but were not otherwise contributed to by them) have been removed
    - the lists aren't numbered anymore because, with this grouping, it was sort of ambiguous whether that referred to a track's position in the album or if it was a continuous counter of the artist's contributions (it was the latter); both such counters can now be displayed by holding still the cursor over a contribution line for a moment
    - removed a few referenced-track contributions i'd missed switching to the new format (distinct reference lists) earlier

    <h2 id="18-nov-19"><a href="#18-nov-19">[[date:18 November 2019]] - high-res cover art</a></h2>
    - copied cover art from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dn2s69/i_was_prepared_for_this_eventuality_and_also/">this archive</a>, which was originally compiled by clicking each cover art off the bandcamp to get a higher-resolution cover art (it is intentionally still less than the resolution gotten in purchased album downloads, for particularly high-res art)
    - commentary for [[album:hiveswap-act-1-ost]]

    <h2 id="16-nov-19" class="major-release"><a href="#16-nov-19">[[date:16 November 2019]] - track references &amp; commentary</a></h2>
    <h3>homepage</h3>
    - got rid of the twitter link on my name and added two links in its place - my twitter and reddit accounts - as well as a note that suggestions and feedback are welcome
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - track references show up in a dedicated list now
    - forward-facing reference links: track pages list not just the tracks they reference, but the tracks <i>which reference them</i>
    - reference data is from <a href="https://homestuck.net/music/references.html"><dfn title="nobody knows what NSND stands for">NSND</dfn></a> (credited on the homepage)
    - "listen on" links show up before the contributor list instead of after; reference list after contributor list
    - at the very bottom, a new section for artist commentary, largely copied from <a href="https://pastebin.com/gqpHsKkE">this pastebin</a>
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - added a message describing dim contribution lines: "Dim tracks are tracks that this artist contributed only a based-upon song to."
    - for tracks with multiple contributors, those are listed as well, e.g. "(with Michael Guy Bowman)"
    - note that this doesn't include "contributors" who only provided a referenced track, since those are now stored in a list separate from the contributors list
    - a new section for commentary
    - a "jump to" paragraph at the top, to quickly scroll to any of the track/art/commentary sections

    <h2 class="major-release" id="15-nov-19"><a href="#15-nov-19">[[date:15 November 2019]] - initial release</a></h2>
    <h3>initial release of the website</h3>
    - published <a href="https://github.com/hsmusic/hsmusic.github.io/">on github</a> with code under the GPL; hosted on hsmusic.github.io
    - advertised exclusively <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/dwtc4w/i_made_a_wiki_for_homestuck_albums_including/">on reddit</a>
    - (and maybe twitter but my account has long been deleted)
    <h3>homepage</h3>
    - an intro message which has since been moved to [[static:about|About &amp; Credits]]
    - a grid listing for the albums: all official releases, from [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead]] through [[album:hiveswap-friendsim]]
    <h3>album pages</h3>
    - album name, release date, track listing, cover art &amp; art credits
    - solo albums also show their artist
    <h3>track pages</h3>
    - track name, release date, artists (musicians), cover art &amp; art credits
    - links to listen to the track too (and code to convert URLs into human-readable site names, e.g. "YouTube" or "Bandcamp" or "(External)")
    - rudimentary leitmotif reference credits in the form of "Contributors" list
    - contributors list also contains credited collaborators on the track, e.g. producers, vocalists
    <h3>artist pages</h3>
    - name, track and art credits
    - artist pages look quite different from today but serve the same purpose of listing their contributions
    - [[root:media/misc/changelog/old-artist-page.png|here's an example]]
    - credits are all in one numbered list; most are just the name of the track contributed to and the album it's from
    - for tracks where an artist made a specific contribution, that's mentioned too, e.g. "Sburban Countdown (arrangement)"
    - if a musician's contribution is simply a track which was referenced, the line for that contribution is slightly dim (it still contributes to the counter)
