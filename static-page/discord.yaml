    HSMusic Wiki has a public Discord server - [you're welcomed to join!](https://discord.com/invite/6Cyt9TY)
    We discuss work-in-progress site updates here, sharing feedback and suggestions before (and after!) releases go online. Active discussion of the [[root:preview-en|preview website]] takes place in the Discord, which also serves as the hub for all kinds of active collaboration on the wiki: localization improvements, bigger data and album additions, revising older data, and so on!
    Plus, most everyone here are avid listeners of Homestuck music and beyond, and we have a dedicated #music-discussion channel for discussing favorites and anything music-related. You aren't obligated to bring anything to the wiki to join; the Discord is also a chill, friendly community to just hang out in!
    There are a few rules you'll have to read and accept before passing beyond the lobby, and we take moderation seriously - but the server is a relaxed space in general! The rules are just there to ensure the community remains safe, relaxed, and welcoming for people of all sorts and persuasions.
