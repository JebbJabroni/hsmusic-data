    We have a public Discord server - <a href="https://discord.com/invite/6Cyt9TY">you're welcomed to join!</a>
    We mostly discuss work-in-progress site updates here, sharing feedback and suggestions before (and after!) releases go online.
    There are a few rules you'll have to read and accept before being let in, and we take moderation seriously - but the server is a pretty chill space in general! The rules are just there to ensure it <i>can</i> be safe and relaxed for everyone.
    (Discord not your style? [[static:feedback|Check our other links!]])
