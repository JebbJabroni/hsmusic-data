    Originally known by the name Witc)(ing )(our [a theme for the Condesce], Fuchsia Ruler was an entry for the Homestuck Album Contest. Since it did in fact win, and was placed on the contest album I had to wait until now to upload it here. You can now download it either from my bandcamp here as a single, or, if you're a fan of homestuck i'd encourage you to download it here from the homestuck bandcamp along with the rest of the album.
