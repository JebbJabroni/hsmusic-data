    <i>Solatrus:</i>
    Vivid Spectrum started out as two completely independent projects; Marcy's project began in June 2012 just before I even moved out to the DC area, and mine started in September.

    Everything: Jeremy Iamurri (Solatrus)
    Also everything: Marcy Nabors (Shadolith - <a href="https://shadolith.tumblr.com/">shadolith.tumblr.com</a> )

    Yes, there is 200% song in this song.
    Except we didn't do the art.
