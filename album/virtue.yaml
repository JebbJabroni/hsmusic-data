Lyrics: |-
    Whoa, yeah I got through September
    Now I'm at your door
    On my knee for the moment
    And will be back for sure
    Oh I wanna savour the landscape
    Of my beating heart
    So I will wait for the moment
    When I'm in your arms

    Hold me tightly, love
    Keep me by your side
    Hold my gentle heart
    Once you burst outside

    Glory, virtue
    Everything that you hold true
    Split myself in two
    Just to love more of you, your
    Kind heart so caring
    Couldn't help myself from sharing
    Split myself in two
    Twice of my love for you

    I skipped a beat
    Now I'm back on my toes
    Hope I won't need much longer
    Aura like a campfire
    Your soothing heat has made me so much stronger
    My heart, my strength
    You've given me shelter
    I'll carry it along
    Until I need to come home
    Rejuvenate in the light of your healing sun

    Hold me tightly, love
    Keep me by your side
    Hold my gentle heart
    Once you burst outside

    Glory, virtue
    Everything that you hold true
    Split myself in two
    Just to love more of you, your
    Kind heart so caring
    Couldn't help myself from sharing
    Split myself in two
    Twice of my love for you

    Glory, virtue
    Everything that you hold true
    Split myself in two
    Just to love more of you, your
    Kind heart so caring
    Couldn't help myself from sharing
    Split myself in two
    Twice of my love for you

    Virtue, virtue
    Virtue, virtue
    Virtue, virtue
    Everything that you hold true
    That's your home
    That's your home
    That's your home
