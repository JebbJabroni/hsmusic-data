    ROYAL LABS ENTRY: ██<br>DATE: 20XX
    <hr>
    The following sounds are a sample of what was recorded during a ten hour audio/visual observation session of a space that lies beyond our own existence, otherwise known as "The Void".
    Experiment " ██████ " no. 4 was headed by ██████ and Dr.████ with assistance from interns S███ and █████.
    Data gathered from Experiment " ██████ " no. 4 has shown a conclusive, definitive link between ██████ and the RESET, SAVE, and LOAD abilities. What this could mean in regards to intern S███'s results from Experiment " ██████ " no.3 is unknown. However, a correlation between certain timelines is present. More research is needed into this matter for a definitive conclusion.

    (there are many notes scribbled in the blank areas surrounding the text, but they are impossible to read. is that bad handwriting, or is that a different language...?)
