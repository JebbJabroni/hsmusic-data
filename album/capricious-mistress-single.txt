    Basically a club dance theme for Fem!Gamzee. not sure how I arrived and settled on that idea, (probably from listening to [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100830182827/http://tindeck.com/listen/ebft">Tents and Mirth</a>] too much), but thats what happened.

    Also, a shout out to [[artist:coffee-and-paperbags]] for drawing the picture and being ok with me using it as the art.

    This was the first track I ever made that was a decent success popularity-wise.
