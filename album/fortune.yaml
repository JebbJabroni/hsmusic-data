    before anything else, this is ultimately a demo! it will be edited more when i go through the big album cleanup later this year, but i have a soft spot for where it is right now, and i don't want to make any more changes until i know what it's going to be paired with. anyway!

    it's difficult for me to talk about this song. i started writing it three years ago in response to the clarion call of a very negative relationship that an ex was trying to revive. "i'm only a body to this person," i thought at the time.

    eventually that line became the chorus, but over the years since i began writing it, my frustration with the subject matter -- greed, abuse, lack of empathy -- broke through into a satirical parroting-back of the things some people would prefer us to be: ever-accommodating supplies of attention and catharsis.

    i wanted to reclaim those "i'm only a body" lines and transform them into something as haunting on its face as it was to me personally... but i also wanted people to know what a surprise they'll be in for should they view others as such.

Lyrics: |-
    Gnihtemos rof gnitiaw neeb ev'i
    Em enifer dna ni emoc
    Ydob a ylno m'i
    Ydob a ylno s'ti
    Ydob a ylno m'i

    The new gods lie in undertones
    And always we feel honor-bound
    That siren song says, "Come along"
    So we crawl that wicked way back down

    Lambs turn into wolves these days
    'Cause no one's hunting hounds
    The gentle things are suffering
    Made monsters on the battlegrounds

    But beggars can't choose
    Where winners never lose
    Ghosts stayed ghosts forever
    Before you came through

    Before you
    
    Oh, come and revive me
    Come take what's inside me
    It's only a body
    I'm only a body

    Come in and refine me
    I've been waiting for something to redesign me
    Come get what you came for
    Pretend I was made for you

    The royals say we must adjust
    So we bite back our wanderlust
    Bring back the golden fleece
    Our money weeps
    It never asked to rule us

    Well, I am just a pattern-finding
    Spot-the-difference machine in
    Gravity's embrace
    For just a second I can witness this

    Where beggars can't choose
    Where winners never lose
    Ghosts stayed ghosts forever
    Before you came through

    Oh, come and revive me
    Come take what's inside me
    It's only a body
    I'm only a body

    Come in and refine me
    I've been waiting for something to redesign me
    Come get what you came for
    Pretend I was made for you

    So come on and try me
    Come put out the fire in me
    If that's how you see me
    If you think it'd be easy
