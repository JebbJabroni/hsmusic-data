    <i>WarxTron:</i>
    28 minute progressive rock song about Caliborn and Calliope. Ft. David Ellis "A Lunatic's Daydream". Made this as my final Homestuck song ever to give closure to those 5 years I spent making songs inspired on it and move on, so I wanted to go out with a bang while paying tribute to my newer musical influences.
    Dedicated to my father.
