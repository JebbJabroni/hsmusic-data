    Split ran up to me saying that he had a problem; the UMSPAF team needed cover art for their latest album, and he asked if I could provide some. So, I did! I tried to evoke the same feelings as the [[album:homestuck-for-the-holidays]] cover without seeming too derivative, so I had the kids take a "backseat" and have a huge cruxite tree with eponymous grist hanging from it be center stage. The result: a peaceful and quiet scene in LOFAF, representing the best of the Gristmas season. (There are four emotes hidden throughout the image. Good luck finding them!)

    When I set out to make my first song for this album I only had two things in mind. The first was to make at least part of it feel like one of those classic 80s Christmas songs that everyone loves, a la Wham!. The second was to make it feel like the in-betweens of the holiday experience: after the unwrapping of presents or whichiver main celebration applies, in the midst of the gathering, before everyone's said their goodbyes and while the spirit of holiday cheer still remains. A theme you could have a cup of hot chocolate to while engaging a seldom-seen relative in lighthearted conversation.
    Whether I succeeded in these things is up to you. But in any case, I had a whole lot of fun making this!

    I had actually written out an entire Troll parody of Michael Caine's line in The Dark Knight talking about working for the local government in Burma, but when I tried recording over the music I realized it ruined a perfectly good jazz arrangement. Now all that's left of Troll Michael Caine is this stupid throwaway intro.

Lyrics:
    you’re a mean one<br>mr. slick<br>you are dark and tall and dumb<br>you’ve got arrows in your eyebrows, scotty dogs up in your bum<br>mr. slick
    I hate a moral coward that lacks a manly spark<br>and god knows<br>you haven’t any heart
    you're a foul one, mr. slick<br>your chest is full of junk<br>your crew's composed of nitwits, and your ships have all but sunk<br>mr. sliiiiiiiiICK<br>if i were forced into a conversation with you, by the end of it i imagine i'd be flat-out druuuuuunk
    you decapitate me, mr. slick<br>you're a greasy greedy hag<br>you're a crippled crooked creeper, and you always prod and nag<br>mr. sliiiiiiiiIIIIIIIIIIIICK<br>the three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote<br>"this, douche, bag"
Commentary:
    <i>WHATISLOSTINTHEMINES:</i>
    This was fairly annoying to put together, as I'm not a particularly strong singer, and I wasn't able to find a good recording environment while I was making this. In any case, I hope you'll enjoy my warbling.

    As you could probably guess, this song was inspired by RJ's Lofam 3 track: [[track:john-do-the-windy-thing]]. I'd like to apologize in advance.

    Caliborn would probably love Christmas, if it were about him, and if all presents people got were also given to him. On Christmas Eve he would travel on his Cairo Overcoat all across the world, taking people's presents from under their trees and hoarding them all, like some sort of weird nega-Santa. Then he'd probably proceed to do nothing with them, because human artifacts are beneath his stature, except when they aren't. What a guy.

Lyrics:
    Been a long time coming for your happy holidays<br>And the winter air is resting on your skin<br>After all the year has brought upon your merry way<br>Take a look behind at everywhere you’ve been
    From the seven gates of Skaia to the Battlefield<br>And the Land of Light and Rain you trode upon<br>Seven years of works Ascending, what it all revealed<br>Was a word that you could cherish standing on
    Stuck at home as snowflakes fall upon your gilded land<br>Like a Witch of Space commencing Medium ground<br>You’re surrounded by a feeling something’s close at hand<br>While the world outside keeps turning round and round
    Scurry out into the alabaster as it spills<br>Step away from all that anchors you below<br>Every day brings you a Choice to make of as you will<br>Choose to be the Hero everywhere you go
    Will you find another universe to fall into<br>Are the other ones not pulling you away<br>Do you look back on the memories in that field of view<br>Did they turn you into who you are today
    Were your closest friends a part of what you’ve loved so long<br>Would you play with them a Session of your own?<br>Are they standing right beside you as you sing this song<br>Don’t you leave them through this season all alone
    And we’ll meet you for another happy holiday<br>When the twilight stars you built upon have gone astray<br>Take your chances, take yourself along and get away<br>For your Ultimate Reward awaits you, don’t delay
Commentary:
    <i>Sean Gorter:</i>
    Imagine me, young Flare, sitting at a piano when all of a sudden - BAM! Musical inspiration strikes! The melody always struck me from the beginning as rather festive-feeling, even if it didn't use the standard musical tropes for Christmas music, so I took this idea and set out to make the most Christmassy electronic music I could make.
    The lyrics also only rather obliquely reference Homestuck; it's never mentioned by name, I chose the most mild-sounding aspects of the story to directly reference, and not once is conksuck or shit lets be santa dropped. But most importantly, the lyrics are for you, dear Homestuck reader, as a reminder that though the year has come to a close, though the act is ending, the future still holds many more in store for you. Your story continues on, so be its hero!
