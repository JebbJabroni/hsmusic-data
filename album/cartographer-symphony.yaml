    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    I've always wanted to write a symphony...so I finally did that. And dang, was this an involved project, although it took much shorter than I was anticipating (six days).

    Compositionally, it's where I want it to be; production-wise, I don't see myself spending more time on it. Perhaps I'll polish it someday, but this is what you have for now.
