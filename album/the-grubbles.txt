Lyrics:
    [Drop to your knees, but come back up swingin'<br>Not just a broom but the truth that we're slingin'<br>Low and diiiirtyyy<br>Show y'all how to bring the hurt we<br>Have been hurt oftennnn
    About now, I bet you're askin'<br>Who are these punks?<br>Or maybe you think we should fetch you a drink?<br>Well in low-blood fashion you can suck my chitin chunk
    Dammek is bronze and burnished<br>I'm just the rust<br>Try to test our mettle, and when the dust settles<br>Your regret will be earnest and your blood spilled to stain the dust
    Drop to your knees, but come back up swingin'<br>Not just a broom but the truth that we're slingin'<br>Drop to your knees, but come back up swingin'<br>Not just a broom but the truth that we're slingin'<br>Low and diiiirtyyy<br>Show y'all how to bring the hurt we<br>Have been hurt by highbloods
    Blood boils<br>Blood boils
    Drop to your knees, but come back up swingin'<br>Not just a broom but the truth that we're slingin'<br>Drop to your knees, but come back up swingin'<br>Not just a broom but the truth that we're slingin'<br>Low and diiiirtyyy<br>Show y'all how to bring the hurt we-]

Lyrics:
    [You pose, all gold and gleaming<br>A ten dressed to the nines<br>Spongeclots deaf to our screaming<br>And to the changing times
    Stay swimming in your mentions<br>Too cold to feel what's coming<br>Why do we mask intentions?<br>All you hear is drumming, drumming
    Drumming, drumming, drumming, drumming<br>Drumming, drumming, drumming<br>Drumming, drumming, drumming, drumming<br>Drumming, drumming, drumming
    Don't bother looking for us<br>As if you even would<br>Just jam out to the chorus<br>As if you understood
    We sing a song of freedom<br>The best track is the last<br>Liner notes, hey did you read 'em?<br>We sang your epitaph
    Blood boils, blood boils<br>Blood boils, blood boils<br>Blood boils, blood boils<br>Blood boils, blood boils
    Baby queen of calamari<br>Gonna fry and dip you<br>Way too late to say you're sorry<br>Way too late to fix you]
