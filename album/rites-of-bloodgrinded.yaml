Lyrics: |-
    Here we go
    Destroy the forces of weak
    Destruction of fucking bloodless scums

    Honor inside
    in our eyes
    In our blood
    in our skies
    Never decieve
    Never forgot
    That are you did
    Never distort

    What inside your blood
    What inside your head
    What inside your mind
    What inside you skull

    Never lick the salt
    Never lick the salt
    Never lick the salt
    As i said
    Drink the Faygo

Lyrics: |-
    Your prophet
    Was a lier
    Your warriors were a fools
    Your hives was in fire
    The fault was yours

    His words was disgusting
    Unsacred mass
    The pure rage was rage was nothing
    Compared to our force

    The words of praying
    They mastered, devoid
    but guts
    On Empress'es Trident

    The Signless will be banished
    And caged forever
    Liberation of this life
    That he wanted to given

    You became a slaves
    You became nothing
    Just destroyed your race
    Just destroyed yourself for nothing

Lyrics: |-
    Terrible capacity of limb bones broken
    Tearing on the pace
    And you now can't hold it

    Darkness coming strive
    Onto you to die
    Coming most destructive
    Coming to cut ye
    No escape to go
    No last words to say

    Why do you in silence, Why do you unexpected a machine psychopath, Why
    do you concise
    You whole

    Come to see and come to greet, Our Imperial Termite
    Our Worker and Our Defender
    Your Death and dust offender
    Your Death and dust offender

    I wanna taste it

    I want to eat is far i can see
    Your life ticket is mine
    I want to hear the crazed cry
    Is ready when you died

Lyrics: |-
    Slowly rotten body
    Moving downwards
    Better be beheaded
    Failing to get blood
    Cornering the breathing
    Ready for the gore
    In total destruction
    The Nekrotroll

    Beautiful
    The gory guts
    Coming to retake the taste
    Our fear to live unwillingly
    Come to everybody's mind
    Worst decisions ever made
    Torn in front of crimson skies
    The infection and disease
    Not the shoot and not the miss (and not be trying to)

    Famine
    Bloodshed
    Slaughter
    Madness
    Honk
    I Hear
    Truth

Lyrics: |-
    They fall slowly
    One by one
    I see em all
    I see em done
    Madness rises from the throne
    I will fall
    And i will call
    The Messiah
    The wicked god
    Creater of the Stoned
    Wounds be penetrate
    Lingers in pain
    In depth it leans when it hurts

    Eyes of Messiah
    Shining down my way
    I will follow Him
    I will make them pray
    I will make them suffer
    I will make them see
    I will make it gone
    Nothing

    Eyes of Messiah
    Shining down my way
    I will follow Him
    I will make them pray

Lyrics: |-
    Try to enjoy your torture
    Torment racks and ties of blood
    Defloration & Mutilation
    Abomination with Horns

    You can feel it anywhere
    In your fracture
    Mutilation of your eyes and guts
    We are wicked in resort
    In the combination
    To fustrate our wicked thoughts

    Our religion
    Is your pain

    Horn and Tentacle Torture
    Horn and Tentacle Torture

    Trying to run
    Trying to hide
    But damage is done
    And we got inside

    Horn and Tentacle Torture
    Horn and Tentacle Torture
    Horn and Tentacle Torture
    Horn and Tentacle Torture
