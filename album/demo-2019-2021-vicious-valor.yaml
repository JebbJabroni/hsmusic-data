Lyrics: |-
    May the fierce
    That you belong to
    Smash the peace
    That they demanded

    May the day
    Endure the sadness
    Make them pay
    For god of Madness

    For god of Madness

    And be gone
    All of deserters
    And be throne
    Flaying the fellows

    Your embrace
    Enflaming Arson
    God is burying
    Into the caskets

    Burning sign
    Of one that willing
    Now is mark of the unfeeling
