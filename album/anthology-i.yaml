    HEY I LIKE DESYNCED AND MADE MUSIC FOR IT, REMEMBER THAT?

    Originally made back in 2021, one of my favorite tracks made for the comic was finally used on the most recent SAHcon trailer for the comic (wich you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jie8P_OG4pM)).

    Despite being quite some time I still love how this track sounds and everything. If you're familiar with my Desynced work, you'll notice the use of a certain motif that relates to what the track was originally intended to.

    So, does a new track signifies that a new Desynced album is "in the works"? WELL, YEAH! LONG LIVE DESYNCED!!!
