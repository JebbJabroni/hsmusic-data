    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i>
    The original version of Spelunky, developed by Derek Yu and now dubbed <a href="https://spelunkyworld.com/original.html"><i>Spelunky Classic</i></a>, released on December 21st, 2008 on TIGSource. Although it was later remastered, that Game Maker version remains freeware.
    Spelunky Classic's retro-style, fondly-remembered soundtrack was composed by [[artist:buzinkai]] and [[artist:jon-perry]], the former of whom only a year or so later composed renowned tracks of the Homestuck discography [[track:doctor]], [[track:explore]], [[track:endless-climb]] and more; Jon Perry has been designing hands-on and video games alike for many years, including other collaborations with Derek Yu.
