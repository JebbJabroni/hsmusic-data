    Single in style of upcoming Album.
    The times comes across. And we handled it.
    The greatest things come together with hands washed by blood.

Lyrics: |-
    Chosen one of all existance
    Fascinated and discrowned
    His ways and grasp soluting
    Hear he say the sound
    The Black Blood

    Claws upon the raining
    Ripping down the flesh
    Ripping down the damned
    Reap the crops that fresh

    I can ever go to battle if i pray for name forgotten to the one

    As He calls
    The keeper of the Skulls of the fallen Trolls

    Eyes are decieving
    Hands are aside
    Wrath is rising
    Up to the size of skies

    In calling the one
    In having the throne
    Exists along
    His Honorable Tyranny

    Why all this a cycle
    Why all this the cost
    Why all this the menace
    I fill my soul
    With dead Miracles
