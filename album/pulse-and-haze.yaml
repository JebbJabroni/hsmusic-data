    <i>Devieus:</i>
    Slowly they rise, slowly they shamble through the mist, slowly they say things to hurt you. They seem familiar, but there's something off about them, they are ghosts, people who don't like you; they may be former denizens or from a different universe, or maybe they only assume that form to unnerve.
