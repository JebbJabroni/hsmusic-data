    A remastered version of [[Rust Apocalypse]], released on the anniversary of the original track, which was itself an arrangement and expansion of [[track:rust-servant|a track I composed]] for the Homestuck album [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]. This version has been remastered from the original stem tracks for a brighter, clearer sound, and parts of the choir have been redone for additional clarity.
