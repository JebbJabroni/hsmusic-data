    concept ep where a virtual dog idol uses vocal synthesizers in her pop music because she has no voice

    ~summer's over but the bangers aren't~

    The idea for this "virtual pop star" came from my personal aspiration to create true pop music– of course, this would be impossible for me through normal channels. I'm trans, and my singing voice is decimated.

    Undeterred, I've been experimenting a lot with vocal synthesis the last couple years, using tools like Vocaloid and sample-editing. The result is After Party Animal, the virtual idol behind these songs.

Lyrics: |-
    Blow south wind
    Pressing send, homing carrier
    I rue, I reap
    I can't keep hold of memory
    Take my hand
    Don't let go, don't say no to me

    Blow south wind
    Pressing send, homing carrier
    I rue, I reap
    I can't keep hold of memory
    Take my hand
    Don't let go, don't say no to me
