    The age of man has ended
    Hubris now exceeds ambition
    A burned-in shadow of yesterday
    A screaming silence echos

Lyrics: |-
    You know, dear listener It’s funny…

    Our plucky protagonists had overcome every trial and tribulation that laid before them. They had forged alliances, gathered their forces, and stood ready to fight against Gaiaeon’s encroachment into their world.

    They planned accordingly down to the most minute details; every step deliberately taken to ensure their victory. Through all of their collective efforts, the twelve believed that overcoming the Naught-father was nothing more than forgone conclusion. A full house waiting to be played…

    But here’s a word from the wise about overconfidence; it’s an insidious poison.

    To such experienced eyes, even a hand like that is no better than a bluff. No one, not even our heroes at the height their power, could have anticipated the terrifying extent of Gaiaeon’s assault.

    And thus, one by one, our heroes fell.

    Everything they had worked toward and fought for was gone in an instant. The promise of a new world forged by the twelve and their many allies left unfulfilled. Hence, nothing remained, not even their regrets

    Their efforts were all for naught.
