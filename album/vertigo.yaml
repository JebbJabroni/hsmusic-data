    <i>Solatrus:</i>
    This is an old song that I had completely forgotten about, started back in 2008. I did a couple tweaks to it to make it stand better with my more recent work, but it still definitely feels like my older Somnium style.

    In fact, the solo in the latter half will certainly remind some of [[track:endless-ocean|Endless Ocean]] or, for those of you who read Homestuck (www.mspaintadventures.com), you may recognize some similarities to [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]]. They both have elements that originated from Vertigo.

    This song was also a part of my scrapped self-titled album, but oh well. That didn't happen.

    Enjoy!
