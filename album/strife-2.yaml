    If you bought [[album:homestuck-vol-7|Homestuck volume 7]], you might be familiar with the bonus track I did on there, [[track:white-host-green-room|“White Host/Green Room”]], which had this garbled cameo of several Homestuck songs in the intro. If that’s the case, this song might sound familiar because it actually appeared in there for a bit.

    Its full name is “The King in Red”, and its supposed to be this weird pseudo-classical apocalyptic black metal remix of [[Karkat's Theme]]. The reason I never finished this up is because I was pretty dissatisfied with the choir samples, which simply weren’t up to the task.

    Human voice is said to be the single hardest thing to emulate through samples, which I guess is because people are generally used to hearing human voices all the time, so they’re much more likely to pick up on stuff that sounds ‘off’ than in the case of, for example, a sampled hurdy gurdy.

    In a lot of ways, it’s kinda similar to the uncanny valley problem with visual art; making a convincing and realistic human face through 3D modelling is very hard to pull off, and I don’t think it’s been seriously attempted since the Final Fantasy movie (And we all know how that turned out for them).

    Even modern CGI movies like Avatar avoid the concept by creating a distinctly alien race that gets just enough humanlike features to make them look relatable and 'cute’.
