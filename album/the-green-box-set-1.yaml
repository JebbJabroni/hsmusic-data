    This is a series of commissions done for the folks at the MS Paint Fan Adventure community. Some tracks may not be publicly available until a later date, and some tracks may be given their own album (at the commissioner's request.)

    By the way, if you're reading this and want to commission music for anything, then please feel free to contact me through Discord (iodbc#7182) or my email (iodbctheblackbox@gmail.com).
