    This month I hooked up my keyboard to my PC and started using Psycle, this is great because I have 10 years of keyboard experience and a sizable VST library; however the theme didn't really allow me to get the best of both of those.

    Remember the <a href="https://youtu.be/Kfq4H6Ouqdc">Diablo 2 cave soundtracks</a>? You will when listening to this, but that was too low pitched to sound right, so now it's a bit better.

    When things go dark and silent, your imagination goes wild, it just starts making things up; this madness is what drives this tune.

    One cannot really make a song called "silence", that would be a paradox; nevertheless I did it before and I've now done it again, this time as a theme song with a cooler title.
