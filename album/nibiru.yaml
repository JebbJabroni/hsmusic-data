Lyrics: |-
    I saw you at the mall last night
    You were looking pretty under the flashing lights, of that storefront
    You were talking with your friends
    And I kinda wished that I was them
    'cause I'm begging, I'm begging,
    I'm begging now, baby I'm down on my knees
    Baby, baby, please can you listen?
    When I say
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    I turned up the stereo
    and I always seem to catch you
    Tried to look so far, for a sign in the stars
    But they all point right back at you
    Your face gets plastered across space
    so I can't escape or forget you
    So I'm begging im begging im begging oh baby im down on my knees
    Baby please can you listen?
    When I say
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
    cause I'm begging, I'm begging,
    I'm begging now, baby I'm down on my knees
    'cause I'm begging, I'm begging,
    I'm begging now, baby I'm down on my knees
    Baby, baby, please can you listen?
    When I say
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    You're breaking my, breaking my,
    Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-heart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    And you're tearing me apart
    Pretty miss you drive me crazy
    I think that I cannot go
    On anymo-o-o-ore

Lyrics: |-
    Underneath the city lights
    A new dawn finally begins
    I am shedding old skin
    I am breaking free from your chains
    There’s no more tears, there’s no more pain
    There’s just laughter in the air
    In the aftermath of love
    My solace is not rare
    As the stage shines bright,
    Bright as the distant sun
    I feel free
    Proud that I decided to run
    There’s no more tears, there’s no more pain
    There is but not one lesson learned
    In this universe of love
    My happiness is earned
    In the Light
    The Light where we once stood hand in hand
    I am twirling solo
    I am taking but one chance.
    As the cheers begin to roar
    As my happiness soars
    I stand tall to play my part
    Let this ephemeral countdown finally start
