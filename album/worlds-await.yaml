    Music is amazingly compact. It is strange how twelve hours of work could go into a four minute track. It's as if one could hide an entire world within each.

    And that's what I feel music is. Hearing a new piece of music is like discovering a new world, feeling its wind and basking in its honey sun.

    This album features no shortage of works inspired by fiction: tributes, rearrangements, commissions and tie-ins for my projects. But more importantly, each track here is a place captured in sound, and I hope you can discover it as you listen.

    This was composed as a tie-in for my novel project [Revolving Door](https://rd.circlejourney.net/). Through the shifts in style and mood, and the interaction of theme melodies, I try to recreate personalities and relationships of various characters in musical form, telling a multiplicity of stories.

    Another tie-in for [Revolving Door](https://rd.circlejourney.net/), this time relating to a chapter of the same title. A girl has just been saved from prison by a young man she does not know (and a rather well-dressed one, at that), and he is taking her to see the city she has not laid eyes on for years.

    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    My tribute to the webcomic Homestuck, which changed me in the best way. The melody came to me while I was reading, and the title is a reference to the names of two characters' planets.

    <i>Circlejourney:</i>
    Written for my a midterm assignment Flash comic. It is the culmination of a story about friends who have grown apart, to the point that they cannot utter a sincere goodbye though one is about to leave the country.

    <i>Circlejourney:</i> (unused lyrics)
    So it comes to this, this parody of
    Everything we used to be, my friends
    I'm not hurt, I'm just afraid
    This is how it ends

    Please don't cry, I'm not mad
    Don't know why I have no tears
    It's kind of sad that the fire will die without a sound
    Now the wheel's turning round
    And all I feel is the pounding of a thousand words unsaid
