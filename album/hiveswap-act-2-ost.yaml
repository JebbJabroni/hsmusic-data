    the hiveswap OST is up on bandcamp, the main bulk of the tracks are collaborations between toby and i, but the trial music was done by @barkbarkclark! check it out!

    i usually try and clean up my tweets so my shitposts or w/e arent the first thing you see when you go to my profile but i accidentally deleted the wrong ones like a clown : )

    ok answerin a few questions:
    [[media:misc/hiveswap-act-2-breakdown.png|here is a breakdown of the OST]] that i made a while ago
    im not in charge of this so, grain of salt, but i THINK yes they are planning to eventually put it on various streaming services
    we will probably not be doing a robust OST commentary this time

    i wrote some songs for this! if you check it out you might hear why my youtube algorithm recommends me nothing but ace attorney soundtracks now
    <i>Quasar Nebula:</i>
    thanks to [[artist:secily-iopara]] for helping out with track metadata and creating a remix of the official cover art which better matches the [[album:hiveswap-act-1-ost]] cover!
