    An in-progress arrangement of [[Serenade]] in a triple meter. The percussion you hear is from knocking on the wood body of a piano.

    This was originally for a totally unrelated project, and turns out if I’m not sure what melody to use in a song I’ll default to Serenade. I’m not quite sure where to take it next, though. Maybe cello. I’ll figure it out.

    > I started listening to the soundtrack for Psycholonials, and realized that I've heard one of the songs before. Turns out The Influencer was originally a piece you made like 10 years ago called "Nepeta in Three" and it was a song I'd just listen to all the time whenever I wanted to feel happy. I'm really glad you got to use it in some official capacity!

    me too!! psycholonials ended up being a supercut of my best b-sides that never got to shine. good catch remembering the nepeta track deep cut after so long!
