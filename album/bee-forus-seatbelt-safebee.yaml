Lyrics: |-
  (It's been a long, hard day.)
  (You're walking down to the shops to buy yourself a glass a nice cool glass of lemonade. (Ahh.))
  (And you seem to have lost your way. Where the shop should be, there is a beehive, and where there should be a shopkeeper, there is a bee.)
  (You approach the bee. He looks up with a menacing pincer snick. You're lost, you explain. You wonder if the bee could direct you to the lemonade. Sweet, sweet lemonade. (Ahh.))
  (The bee looks at you. His mandibles widen. He begins to emit a swarm of yet smaller bees. They surround you, coating your clothes and hair, and infesting your various orifices with their warm, fuzzy mass.)
  (Don't worry, says one of the bees, whispering softly into your ear. (Don't worry.) There is nothing to fear. We are merely bees and bees are your friends. (Don't bee afraid.))
  (You don't understand. All you wanted was some lemonade, its sweet icy coolness. (Ahh.))
  (But now, that life is gone, and the whole world is bees. They are coating the room now. (Don't fight it.) They cover everything, filling it, filling you, with bees.)
  (Join us, they say, their voices a chorus of mournful buzzing. The soft cadence of the noise seems to hang poised in the air, forcefully penetrating your ears, your skull, your mind. (Join us.))
  (Join us, say the bees, and you realise, you're one with the bees. This skin, this shell, is nothing but a minor barrier between you and the bees. You are bees. Glorious crescendo of buzzing rises under your skin.)
  (You are a swarm, rapturous melding of mind and form of bees dissolving to the sound of buzzing in the air, a choir become one with its music, a phoenix of bees risen to take on a greater yet higher form.)
  (You let yourself go. You become one with the bees. You are a bee.)

Lyrics: |-
  (Ladies and gentlemen, and everyone in between and otherwise, I'm here to tell you a story, about a certain man who did not know how to properly wear a seatbelt)
  (That young man's name was Cronus Ampora, and one day he was driving his car, otherwise cruising and bruising, without wearing a seatbelt as mandated by Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard)
  (In just a short time, through a series of trials and tribulations that would affect him on this day, he would discover the secrets of seatbelt safety, and have a convertive and a serious motor vehicle accident because he was unfastened within the vehicle)
  (This is the story of that journey of self-discovery that would affect him for the rest of his life. All of you, I hope you enjoy)
  (No not the bees! Not the bees! Aaaaaaaa!)

  (Damara, help, save me from this creature!)
  (He's got me trapped in the car)
  (Damara, yes, get in the car, g-get in the car)
  (Now that we're in the car, we can...wait, w-who's, who are, oh- oh...)

  (Damara?)

  (Damara, vwhat...)
  (Oh my god)
  (Sort of being attacked here)
  (Maybe later, you and I, we can go back to my respiteblock, and...)
  (Oh, for god's sake)

  Hey there, hello mister safety bot
  Is that a belt that you have strapped on?
  You're teaching Cronus how to buckle up
  But afterward I'll unfasten you

  Unlike other robots, you're concerned
  for our safety, and that's attractive
  Though what's safety without some danger
  If you'd like, then I'll unfasten you

  You make my motor run, keep it on
  I could be the belt to your buckle
  You make my horn go [beep beep], do it again,
  I could be the belt to your buckle

  (Watashi wa anzen botto no dikku wo suushitai desu)
