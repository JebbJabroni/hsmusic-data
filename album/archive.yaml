Lyrics: |-
    Awake again
    Here in my bed
    Eyes staring up at the ceiling

    A breath of air
    Light in my window
    Heart still aglow with the feeling
    I was dreaming

    Another time, another place
    A strange and yet familiar face
    Buried deep within my bed
    I wade through memories in my head

    My sock's half on
    Hand in a book
    Finger is still on the chapter

    We both were there
    I told a joke
    I can't recall what came after
    Just your laughter

    Clock goes off across the room
    And time restarts and life resumes
    I rise to meet the coming day
    But someone's laughing far away

Lyrics: |-
    Keep your eyes on the airwaves
    Don't look down if you don't want to fall
    Out here, ain't nobody dancing
    Up in the air you ain't nobody at all

    Keep your forward direction
    Look for signs of the enemy, enemy
    You're too far gone for protection
    I am a spaceship who's looking for love (yeah)

    Open your doors and shoot your missiles
    Blow away everybody you pass
    Just a bunch of peculiar people
    Looking for a party to crash

    Keep your back to the sunlight
    Keep your eyes on the rubber T-Rex
    Save your teardrops for later
    You're going to need them for the part that comes next

    Wake up trashed in the ocean
    Look for signs of the enemy, enemy
    These drones can feel emotion
    I am a spaceship who's looking for love (yeah)

    Open your doors and shoot your missiles
    Blow away everybody you pass
    Just a bunch of peculiar people
    Looking for a party to crash

Lyrics: |-
    "Yes! This thunderstorm is just what I need to bring my creation life! LIFE!"

    Your career starts with a dream
    That becomes a brilliant scheme
    When you first acquire the rudimentary skills
    Soon you're turning lead to gold
    And making space's fabric fold
    And breathing life into the dead to get your thrills

    You may say it can't be done
    But baby, I am number one
    And the things that I can do
    Prove the facts I know are true!

    MAD SCIENCE
    We do it 'cause we can
    MAD SCIENCE
    It's all part of the plan
    MAD SCIENCE
    Yes, we have got the tools
    Consequence means nothing when you learn to break the rules

    "Steady, now. We wouldn't want to scare the poor creature. Look into its eyes; there's a light behind them. Yes! It's intelligent! It's learning! It's learning! Yes!"

    People first will be impressed
    They will call you a success
    Put your name on some important-sounding prize
    But when it starts to leave a scar
    They will say you've gone too far
    And they'll call your work a dirty pack of lies

    You may say my proofs are wrong
    You may say my tests are flawed
    You can shove it up your flask
    I'm too busy playing God!

    MAD SCIENCE
    We do it 'cause we can
    MAD SCIENCE
    It's all part of the plan
    MAD SCIENCE
    Yes, we have got the tools
    Consequence means nothing when you learn to break the rules

    Losing your patents to idiots in suits
    You run from the world and its trivial pursuits
    Living in exile with henchmen and minions
    Your work's too important for outside opinions

    In a castle far away
    You plot revenge throughout the day
    Putting touches on your horrid master plan
    Those tiny peons would not learn
    Which is why they'll have to burn
    Progress cannot wait upon the will of man

    You may say it can't be done
    But baby, I am number one
    And the things that I can do
    Prove the facts I know are true
    Don't pretend you're not intrigued
    You're as twisted as the rest
    You might mock me in the day
    But at night you are obsessed!

    MAD SCIENCE
    We do it 'cause we can
    MAD SCIENCE
    It's all part of the plan
    MAD SCIENCE
    Yes, we have got the tools
    Consequence means nothing when you learn to break the rules

    "Okay, back to work."

Lyrics: |-
    So far away
    Way out beyond

    No capsule you could swallow
    Could possibly compare
    To the one that swallows you
    And takes you through the air

    Hollow rockets filled with solid fuel
    Faster than the Earth can pull
    Body of the aether's night
    Takes you on your maiden flight!

Lyrics: |-
    Hidden from the naked eye
    Beyond the view of telescopes
    Behind the diamonds in the sky
    From where the oldest light elopes
    Nothing written in the waves
    The signal's clear, the picture's black
    Nothing standing in the way
    The anti-matter stares straight back
    Nothing to see but diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds

    Objects brighter than the sun
    Shift to red and fade away
    A universe built on the run
    Eclipsed so easily by the day
    Nothing written in the waves
    Event horizon, no return
    Nothing standing in the way
    Perhaps these things cannot be learned
    Nothing there but diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds and diamonds

    Who knows what can lie within
    The Bandages

Lyrics: |-
    I'll pack a blanket, a handwoven basket
    Of red roses and wine
    Rest with me here on this bed made of grass
    And I'll know, know that you're mine

    In the cool of the evening the sound of your breathing
    Seems all that you dare need to say
    With incense and flowers, the minutes and hours
    Like fluttering leaves slip away

    The sky turns from blue to an orange to black
    With the slow passage of time
    We ought to be home, but you know that I'm yours
    And I know, know that you're mine

    We will look to the skies with our twinkling eyes
    And we'll write out our names in the stars
    Though it's dark here on land, when we're both holding hands
    All the lights up above will be ours

Lyrics: |-
    Some bands only play in small bars
    Show up in their own cars
    Only just to pass time
    But my band always plays arenas
    You probably have seen us
    Playing at the half time

    Sequined soldiers of the football stands
    Killing our evenings in the marching band
    At every game we're in demand
    Our parents are our biggest fans
    As long as we're in marching band

    Some bands never really get big
    Only play a few gigs
    Not at all immersing
    But my band always goes to contest
    Cannot get a night's rest
    Always up rehearsing

    If the team keeps winning, wouldn't that be grand?
    Going to playoffs in the marching band
    Loading the equipment van
    Testing our attention span
    Oh why'd we join the marching band?

Lyrics: |-
    When the moon is high and the night has fell
    They ride like demons out of hell
    But they're not demons, they are men
    Who send the demons back again

    Men of action, men of dreams
    Armed with guns and laser beams
    Hunting down all supernatural beings

    Explosion Force, they do it right!
    They drop the bomb and win the fight
    Riding in the Explosionmobile
    Fighting for justice and keeping it real

    Who will live and who will die?
    When the war is over, then you'll see why
    Explosion Force, they do it right!

    Roll call!
    Arthur, demolitions expert
    Felix, demolitions expert
    David, demolitions expert
    Bryan, who's also a demolitions expert YEAHHHHH

    Together fights this secret crew
    Sent from VASCU
    A secret cell of the FBI
    Sworn to make motherfuckers die

    Bad guys from the Cult of Scars
    They will find out where you are
    Where there's an ass to kick, they can't be far

    Explosion force, they do it right!
    You may bark, but they will bite
    Ghouls and goblins, you best beware
    You're no match, your ass is theirs

    Who will live and who will die?
    When the war is over, then you'll see why
    Explosion Force, they do it right!

Lyrics: |-
    As I watch this sunset
    The enchantment of the long night descends around me
    Through the fading blue sky, stars arrive quietly
    And the chirps of crickets herald the golden hour

    The day is at an end
    And there are ten million things I'll have to do before I sleep
    In the morning, there will be ten million, yet still
    And then again, a sunset

    But in this moment
    The sun is not just some giant ball put there to make me feel small
    It is an old friend who I have known longer than anyone else
    And this evening, I am by its side to tuck it into bed

    In this moment
    I can feel only the grace of the world around me
    This calm, this light, this air, this body
    This sunset

    Another time, another place
    A strange and yet familiar face

    Finger is still on the chapter

    I can't recall what came after
    Just your laughter

    Clock goes off across the room
    And time restarts and life resumes
    I rise to meet the coming day
    But someone's laughing far away

    Nobody
    Would ever have guessed we'd be homebuddies
    Or that you even would be somebody
    To someone you barely knew like me

    Like me
    Like me
    Like me

    I met you
    Through a mutual friend
    Oh, we were introduced
    All I knew was you liked Doctor Who
    I guess that was good enough for me

    For me
    For me
    For me

    I wanna play that
    Like a snow-baked thing
    I couldn't say that
    'Cuz this ain't just a fling
    I wanna know you
    Like the back of my hand
    I gotta show you
    The person I really am

    We'll make our own world
    Where we can run away
    To where it's all play
    All day
    Yeah yeah yeah

    [Dare you to transcribe this part, Niklink!]

    You called me
    Just seconds before I tried to
    Make my plea
    For you to entertain this
    Fantasy
    So glad to know that it was
    Not just me

    Just me
    Just me
    Just me

    Now you're here
    We're sharing together in these golden years
    And though our lives have many hopes and fears
    I'll be there with you and me

    You and me
    You and me
    You and me
    You and me

    Riding through the night like a jaded vagabond
    No one else in sight I could be the only one
    Hear me radio, play the song I know
    Take me where I long to go

    'Cause there's nobody nobody now
    Who can hear me or stop me now
    In this old buggy old buggy now
    In this old buggy old buggy now

    Guided by the stars burning up petroleum
    Here inside my car I could be the only one
    Somewhere in the sky a satellite on high
    Watches with its lonely eye

    'Cause there's nobody nobody now
    Who can hear me or stop me now

Lyrics: |-
    (The journey made by all)

    I spent the best years of my life waiting
    For this moment
    A time to call my own, a place to call my homeland

    It's come here far too soon
    I sit around my room
    Hatching my plans and schemes I mostly leave forgotten

    I spent my longest nights awake wondering through the outside
    Amused but still deranged, divided on the inside

    Returning to the core
    The place I can't ignore
    The wonder behind the fear I just can't seem to shake off

    Oo-ee-oo
    To dream or do
    To do or die
    To sink or fly

    Oo-ee-oo
    To get a clue
    To run and hide
    To laugh and cry

    I turned my back on battles won and sailed to new adventure
    The journey made by all, a lonely mortal tenure

    To Ithaca I sailed
    And though I have not failed
    My home is a fleeting camp, the journey's just beginning

    Oo-ee-oo
    To dream or do
    To do or die
    To sink or fly

    Oo-ee-oo
    To get a clue
    To run and hide
    To laugh and cry

    I spent the morning hours awake writing down the lyrics
    Resolved to get it right - to capture the true spirit

    Although I sing along
    That moment now has gone
    My heart still a restless sea where Ithaca is calling
