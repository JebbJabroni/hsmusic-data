    <i>AN APPLE DISASTER!!</i><br>That's the name of her song<br>And her name is Apple Girlington<br>She's the personification of<br>An apple
    This spell card is called <i>THE APPLE WIZARD OF MOUNT FUJI</i><br>It's part of important Japanese folk lore<br>The pre-battle dialogue goes like this:
    <i>You should taste my wonderful apples</i><br><i>No, sorry, I'm watching my weight recently</i><br><i>No!! You have to try the apples or I won't let you through!</i><br><i>Oh, well, I'll give you a diabetes bow tie</i><br><i>[UNTRANSLATABLE JAPANESE IDIOM]</i>
    Then you have a weird chord change<br>Because it's a newer Touhou song
    Then they make a joke about apple pie

Lyrics: |-
    (I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? The number I’m thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It’s between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that’s between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It’s my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it for me? I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty, and that it’s between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it? It’s a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and get it? I’m thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won’t you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I’m thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I’m thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won’t you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don’t grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I’m thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty. I’m thinking that the number is probably seven hundred and twenty. Won’t you reach in and grab it for me? But I’m thinking of a number that is between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab a number that’s between my buttocks? The number between four fifty and eight fifty is between my buttocks! The number seven hundred and twenty is between my buttocks! If you can reach in and grab this number that is between my buttocks, you can save a lot of money! The higher the number is between my buttocks, the more money you could save between my buttocks. I’m thinking of a number between my buttocks. This number is the aforementioned number between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is, the better chance you have of saving a lot of buttocks on your credit report. I’m thinking of buttocks between my numbers. The numbers happen to be four fifty and eight fifty, and they are between my buttocks. My buttocks happen to be between the numbers of four fifty and eight fifty. This number is seven hundred and twenty. I’m thinking that the number seven hundred and twenty could save you a lot of money. Do you know why? It’s between four fifty and eight fifty, and it’s also within my buttocks. You can reach in and grab a free credit report, that could save you a lot of money. I’m thinking that it’s between four fifty and eight fifty, and could save you a lot of money. Do you know what it is? It’s my buttocks! That you can reach in between! And get a number! That is seven hundred and twenty! That I am thinking of right now. The number is seven hundred and twenty, and you can reach in between my buttocks and get it. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. I’m thinking you can reach in between my buttocks for a number that’s between four fifty and eight fifty and my buttocks. Do you know what you can reach in between my buttocks to get? It’s your free credit report, and it happens for me to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks if you so choose, to retrieve this number, which is seven hundred and twenty, which happens to be between my buttocks. Why don’t you reach in between my buttocks? The higher that the number you reach in and grab in between my buttocks, the better chance you have at saving a lot of money, after you have reached in and grabbed a number, between my buttocks. I’m thinking though, that you might want to reach in and grab between my buttocks, in order to get a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty. The number that is between four fifty and eight fifty is less that eight fifty and greater than four fifty. And between my buttocks! The number happens to also be seven hundred and twenty, a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. But I’m thinking that this number is greater than four fifty. But is it less than eight fifty? It’s seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be your free credit score. The higher the number, the greater chance you have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks, if you reach in and grab it between my buttocks. I’m thinking you can reach in and grab between my buttocks a number that is seven hundred and twenty, which just so happens to be my credit score. Or, you could grab a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? For me, it happens to be between my buttocks, and the number is seven hundred and twenty. Between my buttocks! You can reach in and grab a number between four fifty and eight fifty that happens so to be between my buttocks. If you grab this number that is between my buttocks, you can get a lot of money. Four fifty and eight fifty. These are the numbers that is has to be between. If you reach in and grab between my buttocks, you could save a lot of money. Your credit score could be saved a lot of. This could save you a lot of money, if you reach between my buttocks. I’m thinking this could save you a lot of money. If you reach in between my buttocks, you could save a lot of buttocks. Save a lot of buttocks in between my buttocks. Reach in between my buttocks and grab the number seven hundred and twenty. Save a lot of money if you grab in between my buttocks and grab a sember that it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. It’s a number between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks, and you can reach in and grab your free credit score which is between four fifty and eight fifty it happens to be in between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, which is also between my buttocks. The numbers four fifty and eight fifty happen to be outside of seven hundred and twenty, which is in between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. Which happens to have the numbers four fifty and eight fifty as the boundaries of seven hundred and twenty. Seven hundred and twenty is a number between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and grab a number. This number is your free credit report, and it happens to be- OH GOD NO! NO! NOO! HELP ME! IT’S EVERYWHERE! YOU CAN REACH IN BETWEEN MY BUTTOCKS! HELP! EIGHT FIFTY! FOUR FIFTY!)

Lyrics: |-
    This first level's song is called Magical Hopalong Cassidy Station.
    This part of the song is just to remind you that it takes place in Japan, in case you forgot.
    This is where we have the sudden transition into the miniboss battle part of the song.
    <i>YOU ACTIVATED MY SPELL CARD, YUGI</i>
    Okay I'm flying toward the ends of the level now.
    Picking up some more uh, powerups.<br>I have not reached max power yet 'cuz it's the first level.
    Now it's coming to a sort of break in the music while you're talking to the boss.

    (Countless bodies remain identified, some ending up in unmarked graves in small border town cemeteries.)

    (I went out on a forensic case and the sheriff had a skull on his office desk. It was the skull of a younger person. And he was using it as a pencil holder. He had pens and pencils in the eye socket of this person. So that's when I decided something had to be done.)

    <i>Solatrus:</i>
    Terra is one of a few tracks I managed to finish in 2009, and is also the first track that I started using my current logo in, however in a much earlier form.
    This song was originally intended to be used in a game, however, it never came to fruition.

    He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well,
    He's finally back to kick some tail,
    His Coconut Gun can fire in spurts,
    If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt,
    He's bigger, faster, and stronger too,
    He's the first member of the D.K. crew!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    D.K., Donkey Kong is here!

    This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes,
    She can shrink in size, to suit her mood,
    She's quick and nimble when she needs to be,
    She can float through the air and climb up trees!
    If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong,
    With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!

    He has no style, he has no grace,
    Th-th-th-this Kong has a funny face,
    He can handstand when he needs to,
    And stretch his arms out, just for you,
    Inflate himself just like a balloon,
    This crazy Kong just digs this tune!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    D.K., Donkey Kong is here!

    He's back again and about time too,
    And this time he's in the mood,
    He can fly real high with his jetpack on,
    With his pistols out, he's one tough Kong!
    He'll make you smile when he plays his tune,
    But Kremlings beware 'cause he's after you!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    Huh!

    Finally, he's here for you,
    It's the last member of the D.K. crew!
    This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny,
    Can make a Kremling cry out for mummy,
    Can pick up a boulder with relative ease,
    Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze,
    He may move slow, he can't jump high,
    But this Kong's one hell of a guy!

    Huh!
    C'mon Cranky, take it to the fridge!

    W-w-w-walnuts. peanuts. pineapple smells.
    Grapes. melons. oranges and coconut shells!
    Ahh yeah!
    Walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells,
    Grapes, melons, oranges and coconut shells!
    Ahh yeah!

Lyrics: |-
    Here we go, off the rails
    Don't you know it's time to raise our sails?
    It's freedom like you never knew

    Don't need bags, or a pass
    Say the word, I'll be there in a flash
    You could say my hat is off to you

    Oh, we can zoom all the way to the moon
    From this great wide wacky world
    Jump with me, grab coins with me
    Oh, yeah!

    It's time to jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)
    Jump up, don't be scared (Jump up, don't be scared)
    Jump up and your cares will soar away

    And if the dark clouds start to swirl (Dark clouds start to swirl)
    Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause
    I'll be your 1-UP girl

    So let's all jump up super high (Jump up super high)
    High up in the sky (High up in the sky)
    There's no power-up like dancing

    You know that you're my superstar (You're my superstar)
    No one else can take me this far
    I'm flipping the switch
    Get ready for this
    Oh, let's do the odyssey

    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, odyssey!

    Spin the wheel, take a chance
    Every journey starts a new romance
    A new world's calling out to you

    Take a turn, off the path
    Find a new addition to the cast
    You know that any captain needs a crew

    Take it in stride as you move side-to-side
    They're just different points of view
    Jump with me, grab coins with me
    Oh, yeah!

    Come on and jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)
    Jump without a care (Jump without a care)
    Jump up 'cause you know that I'll be there

    And if you find you're short on joy (Find you're short on joy)
    Don't fret, just don't forget that
    You're still our 1-UP boy

    So go on, straighten up your cap (Straighten up your cap)
    Let your toes begin to tap (Toes begin to tap)
    This rhythm is a power shroom

    Don't forget you're the superstar (You're the superstar)
    No one else could make it this far
    Put a comb through that 'stache
    Now you've got panache
    Oh, let's do the odyssey

    It's time to jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)
    Jump up, don't be scared (Jump up, don't be scared)
    Jump up and your cares will soar away

    And if the dark clouds start to swirl (Dark clouds start to swirl)
    Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause
    I'll be your 1-UP girl

    Now listen, all you boys and girls (All you boys and girls)
    All around the world (All around the world)
    Don't be afraid to get up and move

    You know that we're all superstars (We're all superstars)
    We're the ones who made it this far
    Put a smile on that face
    There's no time to waste
    So, let's do the odyssey

    Say "Alright!" (Alright!)
    Say "Oh yeah!" (Oh yeah!)
    Whatcha gonna do?  (Whatcha gonna do!)
    (I gotta believe!) I gotta believe!

    If you thought your dreams were fulfilled before
    You need to come on back, Jack
    Look who walked in the door
    It's Parappa The Rapper, and my name is Pos
    I'm known to emcee for free or a cost
    If you be at the mosque, synagogue, or church
    Drop to your knees and pray for Parappa The Rapper
    To save the day and make you scream hooray!
    Just clap on time, 'cause it's time to play

    I know you're slick and smooth, cool with an attitude
    On the right track, leader of the pack
    Kickin' back, never looking back
    You know my words won't satisfy
    What I have now, deep inside of me (Inside of me)
    And all I need is much security

    When you're needed for a mission, he got your back
    Sure to have a cool time, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
    So come on and let's go

    We are the concentrated Vitamin D, with the title
    Hookin' it up, speedy quick, like noodles to cup
    It ain't nothin' for the one man
    Buttin' to move somethin'
    Runnin' par rappin' through laps
    Hurdlin' raps
    And just when you thought your game was dead
    Well, we got you cookin' up rhymes all in your think kettle
    Proceed and click the next level for fun, player (Oh, oh yeah)
    Play ya game, player number one 

    True love that speaks the truth
    You know it'll help me through
    In the cold night
    In the morning, all night
    Or even in a fight
    You know you should come home to me
    We can have fun until the early morning light

    Aw yeah
    Aw yeah, oh
    Oh, oh
    Oh

    Here to serve up a dish like Sunny Chan
    You know I'm the man
    Here to have fun
    Wanna have a taste?
    Here, have some
    Servin' up O's by the oodles
    Oh, I forgot
    Parappa The Rapper, he don't like noodles
    We like eating snapper that's red
    Freestyle from the top of the head
    Yo, Parappa got skill
    Why don't you give it try, see what you can build
    Tasty like fruit that's peeled
    Watch your heels, you might slip and fall
    And if you do, you know who to call (Who?)
    It's Parappa the Rapper and De La, y'all

    You and me can walk together
    And down the road forever
    And smell and touch the treasures of life
    Every day
    Love and hate are face to face
    And good and bad are back to back
    Every day, uh huh
    Uh huh, uh huh, oh yeah, yay

    Switch on your 36 inches
    You in the boob tube, trapped deep
    'Til the game watch you sleep
    Overdosed on moves taught by the sensei
    Your timing's all off, tiger
    You in the little leagues
    Striking out a De La joint
    Book a session for the Plugs and PJ
    To come train the camp, y'all
    Mooselini, graffiti tag and plug dose (Dose, dose, dose)
    Game over, I'm ghost (Ghost, ghost)

    When you're needed for a mission, he got your back
    Sure to have a cool time, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
    Come on, everybody, saddle up and let's go

    All my people say "Alright!" (Alright!)
    Yeah, that was good, now let me hear you say "Oh yeah!" (Oh yeah!) (Oh yeah)
    Now let me hear you say "Whatcha gonna do?" (Whatcha gonna do?)
    Come on, y'all, let me hear you say "I gotta believe!" (I gotta believe!) (Believe...)
    Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yay

Lyrics: |-
    I saved every letter you wrote me
    From the moment I read them
    I knew you were mine
    You said you were mine
    I thought you were mine

    Do you know what Angelica said
    When we saw your first letter arrive?
    She said
    Be careful with that one, love
    He will do what it takes to survive

    You and your words flooded my senses
    Your sentences left me defenseless
    You built me palaces out of paragraphs
    You built cathedrals

    I’m re-reading the letters you wrote me
    I’m searching and scanning for answers
    In every line
    For some kind of sign
    And when you were mine
    The world seemed to
    Burn
    Burn

    You published the letters she wrote you
    You told the whole world how you brought
    This girl into our bed
    In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
    Do you know what Angelica said
    When she read what you’d done?
    She said
    You have married an Icarus
    He has flown too close to the sun

    You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
    Your sentences border on senseless
    And you are paranoid in every paragraph
    How they perceive you
    You, you, you…

    I’m erasing myself from the narrative
    Let future historians wonder how Eliza
    Reacted when you broke her heart
    You have torn it all apart
    I am watching it burn
    Watching it burn

    The world has no right to my heart
    The world has no place in our bed
    They don’t get to know what I said
    I’m burning the memories
    Burning the letters that might have redeemed you

    You forfeit all rights to my heart
    You forfeit the place in our bed
    You sleep in your office instead
    With only the memories
    Of when you were mine
    I hope that you burn

Lyrics: |-
    There's a calm surrender
    To the rush of day
    When the heat of a rolling wind
    Can be turned away

    An enchanted moment
    And it sees me through
    It's enough for this restless warrior
    Just to be with you

    And can you feel the love tonight?
    It is where we are
    It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
    That we got this far

    And can you feel the love tonight
    How it's laid to rest?
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Believe the very best

    There's a time for everyone
    If they only learn
    That the twisting kaleidoscope
    Moves us all in turn

    There's a rhyme and reason
    To the wild outdoors
    When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
    Beats in time with yours

    And can you feel the love tonight?
    It is where we are
    It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
    That we got this far

    And can you feel the love tonight
    How it's laid to rest?
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Believe the very best
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Believe the very best

    Here in the garden
    Let's play a game
    I'll show you how it's done

    Here in the garden
    Stand very still
    This'll be so much fun

    And then she smiled
    That's what I'm after
    The smile in her eyes
    The sound of her laughter

    Happy to listen
    Happy to play
    Happily watching her drift
    Away
    
    Happily waiting
    All on my own
    Under the endless sky

    Counting the seconds
    Standing alone
    As thousands of years go by

    Happily wondering
    Night after night
    Is this how it works?
    Am I doing it right?

    Happy to listen
    Happy to stay
    Happily watching her drift
    Away
    
    You keep on turning pages
    For people who don't care, people who don't care
    About you

    And still it takes you ages
    To see that no one's there, see that no one's there
    See that no one's there, everyone's gone on
    Without you
    
    Finally something
    Finally news
    About how the story ends

    She doesn't exist now
    Survived by her son
    And all of her brand new friends
    
    Isn't that lovely?
    Isn't that cool?
    And isn't that cruel?
    And aren't I a fool to have
    Happily listened
    Happy to stay
    Happily watching her drift
    Drift
    Drift
    Away

    I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in
    They're hypnotized by the way I'm walking
    I've got them dazzled like a stage magician
    When I point they look, and when I talk they listen, well

    Everybody needs a friend
    And I've got you and you and you
    So many I can't even name them
    Can you blame me? I'm too famous

    Haven't you noticed that I'm a star?
    I'm coming into view as the world is turning
    Haven't you noticed I've made it this far?

    Now everyone can see me burning

    I need you in my arms, need you to hold
    You're my world, my heart, my soul
    If you ever leave
    Well, baby you would take away everything
    Good in my life

    Without you
    There'd be no sun in my sky
    There would be no love in my life
    There'd be no world left for me

    And I
    Baby I don't know what I would do
    I'd be lost if I lost you
    If you ever leave
    Baby you would take away everything
    Real in my life

    And tell me now
    How do I live without you?
    I want to know
    How do I breathe without you?
    If you ever go
    How do I ever
    Ever survive?
    How do I, how do I
    Oh how do I live?

    If you ever leave
    Baby you would take away everything
    I need you with me
    Baby 'cause you know that you're everything
    Good in my life

    And tell me now

Lyrics: |-
    I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
    Watch you smile while you are sleeping
    While you're far away and dreaming
    I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
    I could stay lost in this moment forever
    Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
    And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
    Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
    Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
    And I just wanna stay with you
    In this moment forever
    Forever and ever

    I don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    I don't wanna miss one smile
    I don't wanna miss one kiss
    Well, I just wanna be with you
    Right here with you, just like this
    I just wanna hold you close
    I feel your heart so close to mine
    And just stay here in this moment
    For all the rest of time
    Yeah, (Yeah) Yeah, (Yeah) Yeah!

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    Don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    I don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep, yeah

    And dad you might think she's a criminal
    But her friendship comes through subliminal
    Lapis Lazuli, you fled into the bottom of the sea
    Lapis Lazuli, you were so mad, but then you came around to me

Lyrics: |-
    (Maybe he's right, maybe there is something the matter with me)
    (I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad)

    Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
    Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
    Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
    The girl who has everything?

    Look at this trove, treasures untold
    How many wonders can one cavern hold?
    Looking around here you'd think
    (Sure) she's got everything

    I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
    I've got whozits and whatzits galore
    You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
    But who cares? No big deal
    I want more

    I wanna be where the people are
    I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
    Walking around on those
    (What do you call 'em? Oh, feet)

    Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
    Legs are required for jumping, dancing
    Strolling along down the
    (What's that word again?)
    Street

    Up where they walk, up where they run
    Up where they stay all day in the sun
    Wanderin' free, wish I could be
    Part of that world

    What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
    What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
    Betcha on land, they understand
    Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
    Bright young women, sick of swimmin'
    Ready to stand

    And ready to know what the people know
    Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
    What's a fire and why does it, what's the word
    Burn?

    When's it my turn?
    Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
    Out of the sea, wish I could be
    Part of that world

    Why are there so many
    Songs about rainbows
    And what's on the other side?
    Rainbows are visions
    But only illusions
    And rainbows have nothing to hide

    So we've been told and some choose to believe it
    I know they're wrong wait and see
    Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
    The lovers, the dreamers and me

    Who said that every wish
    Would be heard and answered
    When wished on the morning star?
    Somebody thought of that
    And someone believed it
    Look what it's done so far

    What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
    And what do we think we might see?
    Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
    The lovers, the dreamers and me

    All of us under its spell
    We know that it's probably magic

    Have you been half asleep
    And have you heard voices?
    I've heard them calling my name
    Is this the sweet sound
    That calls the young sailors?
    The voice might be one and the same

    I've heard it too many times to ignore it
    It's something that I'm supposed to be
    Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
    The lovers, the dreamers and me

Lyrics: |-
    I couldn't take it, couldn't stand another minute
    Couldn't bear another day without you in it
    All of the joy that I had known for all my life
    Was stripped away from me the minute that you died

    To have you in my life was all I ever wanted
    But now without you I'm a soul forever haunted
    Can't help but feel that I had taken you for granted
    No way in hell that I can ever comprehend this

    I wasn't dreaming when they told me you were gone
    I was wide awake and feeling that they had to be wrong
    How could you leave me when you swore that you would stay?
    Now I'm trapped inside a nightmare every single f'ing day

    It's like a movie, but there's not a happy ending
    Every scene fades black, and there's no pretending
    This little fairy tale doesn't seem to end well
    There's no knight in shining armor who will wake me from the spell

    I know you didn't plan this
    You tried to do what's right
    But in the middle of this madness
    I'm the one you left to win this fight

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you

    I know you're broken down by anger and by sadness
    You feel I left you in a world that's full of madness
    Wish I could talk to you, if only for a minute
    Make you understand the reasons why I did it

    I wanna tell you that you're all that ever mattered
    Want you to know that, for eternity, I'm shattered
    I tried so hard just to protect you, but I failed to
    And in a prison of abandonment I've jailed you

    I never planned that I would leave you there alone
    I was sure that I would see you when I made it back home
    And all the times I swore that it would be okay
    Now I'm nothing but a liar, and you're thrown into the fray

    This bedtime story ends with misery ever after
    The pages are torn, and there's no final chapter
    I didn't have a choice, I did what I had to do
    I made a sacrifice, but forced a bigger sacrifice on you

    I know you've lived a nightmare
    I caused you so much pain
    But, baby, please don't do what I did
    I don't want you to waste your life in vain

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you.

    You're not the only one who needed me; I thought you understood
    You were the one I needed, and you left me as I always feared you would
    Would I change it if I could?
    Both voices: It doesn't matter how
    The petals scatter now
    Every nightmare just discloses
    It's your blood that's red like roses
    And no matter what I do
    Nothing ever takes the place of you

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you

Lyrics: |-
    This is Garnet
    Back together
    And I'm never going down at the hands of the likes of you because I'm so much better
    And every part of me is saying "Go get her"

    The two of us ain't gonna follow your rules
    Come at me without any of your fancy tools
    Let's go, just me and you
    Let's go, just one on two

    Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able
    Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
    I can see you hate the way we intermingle
    But I think you're just mad 'cause you're single

    And you're not gonna stop what we made together
    We are gonna stay like this forever
    If you break us apart, we'll just come back newer
    And we'll always be twice the gem that you are

    I am made
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of

    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    Lo-o-o-o-ove

    This is who we are
    This is who I am
    And if you think you can stop me
    Then you need to think again

    'Cause I am a feeling
    And I will never end
    And I won't let you hurt my planet
    And I won't let you hurt my friends

    Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able.
    Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
    I know you think I'm not something you're afraid of
    'Cause you think that you've seen what I'm made of

    But I am even more than the two of them
    Everything they care about is what I am
    I am their fury, I am their patience
    I am a conversation

    I am made
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    And it's stronger than you

    L-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    L-o-o-o-ove
    And it's stronger than you

    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    And it's stronger than you

    Lo-o-o-o-ove

Lyrics: |-
    It's... Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
    If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

    Because I was afraid to speak
    When I was just a lad
    Me father gave me nose a tweak
    And told me I was bad
    But then one day I learned a word
    That saved me achin' nose
    The biggest word you ever heard
    And this is how it goes

    Oh! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
    If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

    He traveled all around the world
    And everywhere he went,
    He'd use his word and all would say
    There goes a clever gent

    When Dukes and Maharajas pass
    the time of day with me
    I say me special word and then
    They ask me out to tea

    Oh! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
    If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

    (You know, you can say it backwards, which is dociousaliexpilistic-fragilcalirupus, but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?)
    (Indubitably.)

    So when the cat has got your tongue
    There's no need for dismay (Hear hear!)
    Just summon up this word and then
    You've got a lot to say
    But better use it carefully
    Ir it could change your life

    (For example...)
    (Yes?)
    (One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife! Ow! And a lovely thing she is, too!)

    She's... Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Lyrics: |-
    Maybe you've heard of a terrible place
    Where the scoundrels of Paris collect in a lair
    Maybe you've heard of that mythical place
    Called the Court of Miracles
    (Hello, you're there!)

    Where the lame can walk
    And the blind can see
    But the dead don't talk
    So you won't be around to reveal what you've found

    We have a method for spies and intruders
    Rather like hornets protecting their hive
    Here in the Court of Miracles
    Where it's a miracle if you get out alive!

    Justice is swift in the Court of Miracles
    I am the lawyers and judge all in one
    We like to get the trial over with quickly
    Because it's the sentence that's really the fun!

    (Any last words?)
    [muffled speech]
    (That's what they all say.)

    Now that we've seen all the evidence
    (Wait! I object!) (Overruled!)
    (I object!) (Quiet!)
    (Dang.)

    We find you totally innocent
    Which is the worst crime of all
    So you're going to hang!

Lyrics: |-
    Krrr, amadou!

    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!

    In case you forgot or fell off, I'm still hot, knock your shell off
    My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off
    The franchise, doing big business, I live this
    It's automatic I win this, oh, you hear those horns, you finished

    A soldier, and I stay under you fighting
    Plus I'm storming on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning
    Ain't no way you breaking me, kid, I'm harder than nails
    Plus I keep it on lock like I'm part of the jail

    I'm slaughtering stale competition, I got the whole block wishing
    They could run with my division but they gone fishing
    With no bait, kid, your boy hold weight
    I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate

    In any weather, I'm never better, your boy's so hot
    You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
    If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan
    Lay yo' ass down for the three-second tan

    Krrr, amadou!
    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!

    Yeah, uh
    It's gonna be what it's gon' be
    Five pounds of courage buddy, beige tint pants with a gold T
    Uh, it's a war dance and victory step
    A raw stance is a gift when you insist it's my rep
    John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so and talk about
    The bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough, though
    Aimin' guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
    When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
    See what happens when the ice age melt
    You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
    I rock a timepiece by Benny, if any
    The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
    A man's measured by the way that he thinks
    Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
    I spent twenty-plus years seeking knowledge of self
    So, for now, Marc Predka's living live for wealth

    Krrr, amadou!
    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!
    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy, I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!

    Here's a little lesson in trickery
    This is going down in history

    You have to chase a superhero on the run

    Just follow my moves, and sneak around
    Be careful not to make a sound

    We are Number One

    If you're evil, and you're on the rise
    You can count on the four of us taking you down
    'Cause we're good and evil never beats us
    We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

    We'll always save the day
    And if you think we can't
    We'll always find a way

    What we really are
    When we arrived on Earth
    From out beyond your star

    We were amazed to find
    Your beauty and your worth
    And we will protect your kind
    And we will protect your Earth
    And we will protect your Earth
    And we will protect you!

    I will fight for the place where I'm free
    To live together and exist as me
    I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz
    And everything that she believed in

    I will fight for the world I was made in
    The Earth is everything I've ever known
    I will fight to be everything
    that everybody wants me to be when I'm grown!    
    The odds are against us, this won't be easy

    Why would you want to be here?
    What do you ever see here
    That doesn't make you feel worse than you do?
    And tell me, what's the use of feeling, Blue?

    Why would you want to employ her
    Subjects that destroyed her?
    Why keep up her silly zoo?
    Oh tell me what's the use of feeling, Blue?

    An army has a use, they can go and fight a war
    A Sapphire has a use, she can tell you what it's for
    An Agate terrifies, a Lapis terraforms
    Where's their Diamond when they need her Blue?
    You've got to be a leader Blue!

    Yes, of course we still love her
    And we're always thinking of her
    But now there's nothing we can do

    So tell me
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling Blue?

    Ohh
    How can you stand to be here with it all (Here with it all)
    Drowning in all this regret
    Wouldn't you rather forget her?

    Ohh
    Won't it be grand to get rid of it all? (Rid of it all)
    Let's make a plan of attack
    Start looking forward and stop looking back

    Ohh
    Yes of course, we still love her
    And we're always thinking of her
    Don't you know I miss her too?

    But tell me
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?

Lyrics: |-
    You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
    You really are a heel
    You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
    You're a bad banana with a... greasy black peel!

    You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
    Your heart's an empty hole
    Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
    I wouldn't touch you with a... thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

    You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
    You have termites in your smile
    You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
    (Given a choice between the two of you I'd take..)
    The seasick crocodile!

    You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
    You're a nasty-wasty skunk
    Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
    (The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote:)
    Stink, stank, stunk!

    You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
    You're the king of sinful sots
    Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
    (Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable, mangled up in...)
    Tangled up knots!

    You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
    With a nauseous super naus
    You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
    (You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich...)
    With arsenic sauce!

Lyrics: |-
    Way down in the Congoland
    Lived a happy chimpanzee
    She loved a monkey with a long tail
    Lordy, how she loved him

    Each night he would find her there
    Swinging in the coconut tree
    And the monkey gay
    At the break of day
    Loved to hear his Chimpie say

    Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Said the Chimpie to the Monk
    Baba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Said the Monkey to the Chimp

    All night long they'd chatter away
    All day long there were happy and gay
    Swinging and singing in their hunky-monkey way

    Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Means "Monk, I love but you"
    Baba daba dab in monkey talk
    Means "Chimp, I love you, too"

    Then the big baboon one night in June
    He married them and very soon
    They went upon their aba daba honeymoon

    Well, you should have heard that band
    Play upon their wedding day
    Each Chimp and Monkey had nutshells
    Lordy, how they played them

    And now it is every night
    High up in the coconut tree
    It's the same old thing
    With the same old swing
    When the Monk and Chimpie sing

    Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Said the Chimpie to the Monk
    Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
    Said the Monkey to the Chimp

    All night long they'd chatter away
    All day long there were happy and gay
    Swinging and singing in their hunky-monkey way

    Aba daba daba daba doodly daba dab
    Means "Monk, I love but you"
    Baba daba dab in monkey talk
    Means "Chimp, I love you, too"

    And one day when both made man and wife
    They shouted out "This am the life"
    Returning from their aba daba honeymoon

    The provided lyrics are the most common version of this French nursery rhyme, and are a parody of "La Confidence naïve", a 1774 poem that was the first known publication of the melody set to words. The tune itself was first published in 1761 and is an anonymous pastoral song believed to date back to the 1740s. This melody forms the basis of not only the [[track:alphabet-song]], but also other nursery rhymes like "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" and "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep".

Lyrics: |-
    Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul
    With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
    And his eyes made out of coal

    Frosty the Snowman made the children laugh and play
    And weren't they surprised when before their eyes
    He came to life that day

    There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
    For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around, oh

    Frosty the Snowman was as live as he could be
    And the children say he could laugh and play
    Just the same as you and me

    Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
    So he said: Let's run and we'll have fun
    Before I melt away

    So down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
    Running here and there all around the square
    Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'

    He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
    And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, 'Stop!'

    For Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
    But he waved goodbye saying: Don't you cry
    I'll be back again, someday

    There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
    For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around, oh

    Frosty the Snowman was as live as he could be
    And the children say he could laugh and play
    Just the same as you and me

    Dam-pe-dip-dam-dam, dam-pe-dip-dam-dam
    Look at Frosty go!
    Dam-pe-dip-dam-dam, dam-pe-dip-dam-dam
    Over the hills of snow!

    God rest you merry, gentlemen
    Let nothing you dismay
    Remember Christ our Savior
    Was born on Christmas Day
    To save us all from Satan's power
    When we were gone astray

    O tidings of comfort and joy
    Comfort and joy
    O tidings of comfort and joy

    In Bethlehem, in Jewry
    This blessed babe was born
    And laid within a manger
    Upon this blessed morn
    The which his mother Mary
    Did nothing did take in scorn

    O tidings of comfort and joy
    Comfort and joy
    O tidings of comfort and joy

    From God our heavenly Father
    A blessed angel came
    And unto certain shepherds
    Brought tidings of the same
    How that in Bethlehem was born
    The Son of God by Name

    O tidings of comfort and joy
    Comfort and joy

    Alas my love, ye do me wrong
    To cast me off discourteously
    And I have loved you so long
    Delighting in your company

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    I have been ready at your hand
    To grant what ever you would crave
    I have both waged life and land
    Your love and good-will for to have

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    I bought thee kerchers to thy head
    That wre wrought fine and gallantly
    I kept thee both at board and bed
    Which cost my purse well favouredly

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    I bought thee petticoats of the best
    The cloth so fine as fine might be
    I gave thee jewels for thy chest
    And all this cost I spent on thee

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy smock of silk, both fair and white
    With gold embroidered gorgeously
    Thy petticoat of sendal right
    And these I bought thee gladly

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy girdle of gold so red
    With pearls bedecked sumptuously
    The like no other lasses had
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy purse and eke thy gay gilt knows
    Thy pincase gallant to the eye
    No better wore the burgess' wife
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy crimson stockings all of silk
    With gold all wrought above the knee
    Thy pumps as white as was the milk
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy gown was of the grassy green
    Thy sleeves of satin hanging by
    Which made thee be our harvest queen
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy garters fringed with the gold
    And silver aglets hanging by
    Which made thee blithe for to behold
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    My gayest gelding I thee gave
    To ride wherever liked thee
    No lady ever was so brave
    And yet tho wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    My men were clothed all in green
    And they did ever wait on thee
    All this was gallant to be seen
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    They set thee up, they took thee down
    They served thee with humility
    Thy foot might not once touch the ground
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    For every morning when thou rose
    I sent thee dainties orderly
    To cheer thy stomach from all woes
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    And who did pay for all this gear
    That thou didst spend when pleased thee?
    Even I that am rejected here
    And thou disdainst to love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Well I will pray to God on high
    That thou my constancy mayst seen
    And that yet once before I die
    Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Greensleeves now, farewell, adieu
    God I pray to prosper thee
    For I am still thy lover true
    Come once again and love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The first known versions of Greensleeves date from the 1580. Two versions of the ballad were registered on the same day, one as "A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves" and another as "Ye Ladie Greene Sleeves answere to Donkyn hir frende", but the tune certainly predates these versions and authors. There have been countless variations of the lyrics and other lyrics set to the tune, but its association with Christmas came at a later date. The provided lyrics are from the 1584 publication "A Handful of Pleasant Delights", where it was known as "A New Courtly Sonnet of the Lady Green Sleeves. To the new tune of Green Sleeves."

    I've made some effort to update the spelling to modern standards, but don't blame me if some verses don't rhyme; blame the Great Vowel Shift.

    Good King Wenceslas look'd out
    On the Feast of Stephen
    When the snow lay round about
    Deep, and crisp, and even
    Brightly shone the moon that night
    Though the frost was cruel
    When a poor man came in sight
    Gath'ring winter fuel

    Hither, page, and stand by me
    If thou know'st, telling
    Yonder peasant who is he?
    Where and what his dwelling?
    Sire, he lives a good league hence
    Underneath the mountain
    Right against the forest fence
    By Saint Agnes' fountain

    Bring me flesh, and bring me wine
    Bring me pine logs hither
    Thou and I will see him dine
    When we bear them thither
    Page and monarch forth they went
    Forth they went together
    Through the rude wind's wild lament
    And the bitter weather

    Sire, the night is darker now
    And the wind blows stronger
    Fails my heart I know not how
    I can go no longer
    Mark my footsteps, good my page
    Tread thou in them boldly
    Thou shalt find the winter's rage
    Freeze thy blood less coldly

    In his master's steps he trod
    Where the snow lay dinted
    Heat was in the very sod
    Which the Saint had printed
    Therefore, Christian men, be sure
    Wealth or rank possessing
    Ye who now will bless the poor
    Shall yourselves find blessing

    Foot balls, foot balls
    There was a man went to the war
    Foot balls, says I
    There was a man went to the war
    The greatest fool you ever saw
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    He had a hat but ne'er a coat
    Foot balls, foot balls
    He had a hat but ne'er a coat
    Foot balls, says I
    He had a hat but ne'er a coat
    So he buttoned his pantaloons up to his throat!
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    The ladies fell in love with him
    Foot balls, foot balls
    The ladies fell in love with him
    Foot balls, says I
    The ladies fell in love with him
    His maiden name I think was Jim
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    You ought to see them sing and jump
    Foot balls, foot balls
    You ought to see them sing and jump
    Foot balls, says I
    You ought to see them sing and jump
    And chase the Old Boy round a stump
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    The woods with shout and chorus rang
    Foot balls, foot balls
    The woods with shout and chorus rang
    Foot balls, says I
    The woods with shout and chorus rang
    And this was one of the songs they sang
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    The Merrimack was all the talk
    Foot balls, foot balls
    The Merrimack was all the talk
    Foot balls, says I
    The Merrimack was all the talk
    But the little Monitor made her walk!
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    John Bull don't like our ironclads
    Foot balls, foot balls
    John Bull don't like our ironclads
    Foot balls, says I
    John Bull don't like our ironclads
    Nor Frenchy our columbiads
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl

    They make them feel so very queer
    Foot balls, foot balls
    They make them feel so very queer
    Foot balls, says I
    They make them feel so very queer
    I hardly think they'll interfere
    And we'll all drink stone blind
    Johnny fill up the bowl
    And we'll all drink stone blind

    Oh, the weather outside is frightful
    But the fire is so delightful
    And since we've no place to go
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

    It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
    And I've brought some corn for poppin'
    The lights are turned down low
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

    When we finally kiss good night
    How I'll hate going out in a storm
    But if you'll really hold me tight
    All the way home I'll be warm

    The fire is slowly dyin'
    And my dear, we're still goodbyin'
    As long as you love me so
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

    When we finally kiss good night
    How I'll hate to go out in a storm
    But if you'll really hold me tight
    All the way home I'll be warm

    The fire is slowly dyin'
    And my dear, we're still goodbyin'

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    Messiah has 53 movements. A full performance of the oratorio usually takes over two hours, not counting intermission time. However it is most enduring in popular culture—and probably being referenced in this wiki because of—the 44th movement, aka the "Hallelujah Chorus", and that movement is the only one included in the provided lyrics. The words are from the King James Bible, Revelation 19:6, 11:15, and 19:16.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    While this composition is commonly known as the "Moonlight Sonata", the name comes from a critic's remark on this work a few years after Beethoven's death. This sonata, Piano Sonata No. 14, was published alongside his (much less well-known) Piano Sonata No. 13, both under the title "Sonata quasi una Fantasia" (<i>Sonatas in the style of a Fantasia</i>), categorized as his opus number 27.

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The lyrics by [[artist:talhaiarn]] were publshed in 1862, alongside the original [[track:deck-the-halls]] lyrics. (Thank you to megatti from the HSMusic Wiki for providing a translation!) However the most popular Welsh lyrics for this melody were published in 1873 by [[artist:john-ceiriog-hughes]], and are shown here as alternate lyrics. They're not only completely different but also were published alongside another completely separate set of English lyrics, 'Soon The Hoar Old Year Will Leave Us' by John Oxenford. The original melody dates back to 16th-century Wales.

Lyrics: |-
    I've just come back from a lovely trip
    Along the Milky Way
    I stopped off at the North Pole
    To spend the holiday

    I called on dear old Santa Claus
    To see what I could see
    He took me to his workshop
    And told his plan to me

    So you better watch out
    You better not cry
    You better not pout
    I'm telling you why
    Santa Claus is comin' to town

    He's making a list
    Checking it twice
    Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
    Santa Claus is comin' to town

    He sees you when you're sleeping
    He knows when you're awake
    He knows if you've been good or bad
    So be good for goodness' sake

    Oh you better watch out
    You better not cry
    You better not pout
    I'm telling you why
    Santa Claus is comin' to town

    Oh you better watch out
    You better not cry

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    This carol dates from the 13th century though its first known printing is in "Piae Cantiones ecclesiasticae et scholasticae veterum episcoporum" (<i>Pious ecclesiastical and school songs of the ancient bishops</i>) from 1582. The provided English versions of the lyrics come from "The Oxford Book of Carols" from 1928, probably the most well known translation. It is a free translation, rather than a literal one, in order to fit the lyrical structure and flow of the "Flower Carol". The added doxology at the end of the translation is not included.

Track: The Anacreontic Song

Lyrics: |-
    To Anacreon, in Heav'n, where he sat in full glee
    A few sons of harmony sent a petition
    That he their inspirer and patron would be
    When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian
    Voice, fiddle and flute, no longer be mute
    I'll lend ye my name, and inspire you to boot
    And, besides, I'll instruct you, like me, to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And, besides, I'll instruct you, like me, to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    The news through Olympus immediately flew
    When Old Thunder pretended to give himself airs
    If these mortals are suffer'd their scheme to pursue
    The devil a goddess will stay above stairs
    Hark! Already they cry in transports of joy
    Away to the Sons of Anacreon we'll fly
    And there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    The yellow-hair'd god, and his nine fusty maids
    From Helicon's banks will incontinent flee
    Idalia will boast but of tenantless shades
    And the biforked hill a mere desert will be
    My Thunder, no fear on't shall soon do its errand
    And dam'me! I'll swing the ringleaders, I warrant
    I'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    I'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    Apollo rose up; and said, Pr'ythee ne'er quarrel
    Good King of the gods, with my vot'ries below!
    Your thunder is useless- then, shewing his laurel
    Cry'd, Sic evitabile fulmen, you know!
    Then over each head my laurels I'll spread
    So my sons from your crackers no mischief shall dread
    Whilst snug in their club-room, they jovially twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    Whilst snug in their club-room, they jovially twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    Next Momus got up, with his risible phiz
    And swore with Apollo he'd cheerfully join
    The full tide of harmony still shall be his
    But the song, and the catch, and the laugh shall be mine
    Then, Jove, be not jealous of these honest fellows
    Cry'd Jove, We relent, since the truth you now tell us
    And swear by Old Styx that they long shall entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And swear by Old Styx that they long shall entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    Ye sons of Anacreon, then, join hand in hand
    Preserve unanimity, friends and love
    'Tis your's to support what's so happily plan'd
    You've the sanction of gods, and the fiat of Jove
    While thus we agree, our toast let it be
    May our club flourish happy, united, and free!
    And long may the sons of Anacreon entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And long may the sons of Anacreon entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

Track: The First Noel

Lyrics: |-
    The first Noel the angels did say
    Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
    In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
    On a cold winter’s night that was so deep

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    They looked up and saw a star
    Shining in the east, beyond them far
    And to the earth it gave great light
    And so it continued, both day and night

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    And by the light of that same star
    Three wise men came from country far
    To seek for a king was their intent
    And to follow the star wherever it went

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    This star drew nigh to the northwest
    O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
    And there it did both stop and stay
    Right over the place where Jesus lay

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Then did they know assuredly
    Within that house, the king did lie
    One entered in then for to see
    And found the babe in poverty

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Then enter'd in those wise men three,
    Full reverently upon their knee,
    And offer'd there, in his presence,
    Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Between an ox stall and an ass
    This child truly there born he was
    For want of clothing they did him lay
    All in a manger, among the hay

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Now let us all with one accord
    Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
    That hath made heaven and earth of nought
    And with his blood mankind hath bought

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    If we in our time shall do well
    We shall be free from death and Hell
    For God hath prepared for us all
    A resting place in general

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The provided lyrics are derived from the first known publication of the carol, known then as "The First Nowell", in 1823. The melody is believed to date from at least the eighteenth century, though it is possibly hundreds of years older, and with endless existing variations to its lyrics.

Lyrics: |-
    Dashing through the snow
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    O'er the fields we go
    Laughing all the way
    Bells on bob tail ring
    Making spirits bright
    What fun it is to ride and sing
    A sleighing song tonight! Oh!

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

    A day or two ago
    I thought I'd take a ride
    And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
    Was seated by my side
    The horse was lean and lank
    Misfortune seemed his lot
    He got into a drifted bank
    And then we got upsot

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

    A day or two ago
    The story I must tell
    I went out on the snow
    And on my back I fell
    A gent was riding by
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    He laughed as there I sprawling lie
    But quickly drove away, ah!

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

    Now the ground is white
    Go it while you're young
    Take the girls tonight
    and sing this sleighing song
    Just get a bobtailed bay
    Two forty as his speed
    Hitch him to an open sleigh
    And snap! you'll take the lead

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

Lyrics: |-
    O say can you see, by the dawn's early light
    What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
    Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
    O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
    And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
    Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
    O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

    On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
    Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
    What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
    As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
    Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
    In full glory reflected now shines in the stream
    'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

    And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
    That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
    A home and a country, should leave us no more?
    Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution
    No refuge could save the hireling and slave
    From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
    And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

    O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
    Between their loved homes and the war's desolation
    Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
    Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
    Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just
    And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'
    And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

    When Johnny comes marching home again
    Hurrah! Hurrah!
    We'll give him a hearty welcome then
    Hurrah! Hurrah!
    The men will cheer and the boys will shout
    The ladies they will all turn out
    And we'll all feel gay
    When Johnny comes marching home

    The old church bell will peal with joy
    Hurrah! Hurrah!
    To welcome home our darling boy
    Hurrah! Hurrah!
    The village lads and lassies say
    With roses they will strew the way
    And we'll all feel gay
    When Johnny comes marching home

    Get ready for the Jubilee
    Hurrah! Hurrah!
    We'll give the hero three times three
    Hurrah! Hurrah!
    The laurel wreath is ready now
    To place upon his loyal brow
    And we'll all feel gay
    When Johnny comes marching home

    Let love and friendship on that day
    Hurrah, hurrah!
    Their choicest pleasures then display
    Hurrah, hurrah!
    And let each one perform some part
    To fill with joy the warrior's heart
    And we'll all feel gay

    Feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good

    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good

    City's breaking down on a camel's back
    They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
    So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
    You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
    You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
    A melancholy town where we never smile
    And all I wanna hear is the message beep
    My dreams, they got a kissing
    'Cause I don't get sleep, no

    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Turn forever hand in hand
    Take it all in on your stride
    It is ticking, falling down
    Love forever, love is freely
    Turned forever, you and me
    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Is everybody in?

    Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
    Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
    Play these ponies at the track
    It's my chocolate attack

    Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
    Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
    Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
    With yo' sound, you in the blink
    Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
    With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
    So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
    Until you're cheddar headed
    And watch the way I navigate
    Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good

    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Turn forever hand in hand
    Take it all in on your stride
    It is ticking, falling down
    Love forever, love is freely
    Turned forever, you and me
    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Is everybody in?

    Don't stop, get it, get it
    Peep how your captain's in it
    Steady, watch me navigate
    Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Don't stop, get it, get it
    Peep how your captain's in it
    Steady, watch me navigate
    Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Listen up, y'all, 'cause this is it
    The beat that I'm bangin' is delicious

    Fergalicious, definition make them boys go loco
    They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo
    You could see me, you can't squeeze me
    I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
    I got reasons why I tease 'em
    Boys just come and go like seasons

    But I ain't promiscuous
    And if you was suspicious
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah)

    And they be lining down the block
    Just to watch what I got (Four, tres, two, uno)

Lyrics: |-
    (Uh... Scott Stutzman... [pronounced 'Stootzman'])
    (It's pronounced 'Thompson'. Scott Thompson. No it's Stutzman.)
    (Okay. Stutzman. Not Stootzman but Stutzman. Okay.) (Stutzman. Stutzman. Stutzman.)
    (And, uh, he's our- my Songwriting 2 student from, uh, Spring Creek, and he's gonna play a little band, uh, ukulele, and...)
    (It feels perfect. Thank you.)
    (Does that sound good?) (Of course it sounds good.)
    (I don't know Scott's song title, you'll have to tell them.) (Oh, okay, well this uh, has a little bit of a story attached. Uh one of my favorite breakfast cereals of all time is... Fruity Pebbles. And I realized the other day that Fruity Pebbles doesn't have a slogan or a jingle associated with it. So what i did was I just wrote a short little jingle that they would probably love to use in one of their commercials. Uh the song is called... Fruity Pebbles Jingle.) [mild clapping] (Thank you I love America too.)

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning
    Those colorful enchanting little specks
    They make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning
    In a way they never do when I eat Chex

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'
    I shove 'em by the fistful in my trap
    They got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin
    And make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap

    Yeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation
    They're tiny tasty munchable and sweet
    I'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation
    And murder every other breakfast treat

    And the gallows will sway through the night
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    All cereals bow down in fright
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Sycophants and cowards flee
    From Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Captain Crunch on bended knee
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    The balance of the world's askew
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Promise revolutions new
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    What cereal 'mongst other things
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Stays crunchy in the blood of kings?
    It's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    (Alright, still goin'. Ridin' that Pebble train.)
    City-states and emirates and commonwealths and counties
    Imagine how they will react with glee
    As the early dawn reflects upon all nature's greatest bounty
    Of soybean oil and red dye number three

    Oh ministers and magistrates can't stop the people's yearning
    For the turning of the powers yet to be
    And presidents and potentates can't stop the fires burning
    As we cast their ivory towers to the sea

    And the creatures of the forest hark
    To Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Noble stag and yellow lark
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The innocence of children's eyes
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Will watch that Fruity flag rise
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    United we shall march along
    With Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Some shall die but we'll fight on
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The fife shall play its soaring note
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    We'll slit every dissenting throat
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    This vow for glory we must keep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Though God himself may turn and weep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Do not fear the cleansing flood
    Of Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    A breakfast table stained with blood
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    AAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    OOOOOooooooo.....

    (I really like Fruity Pebbles.)
    (Well thank you Scott. Thank goodness for comedians. You know? It lightens our day.)
    (It-that-it wasn't supposed to be funny.)

Lyrics: |-
    The Michael Rosen Rap!

    You may think I'm happy
    You may think I'm sad
    You may think I'm crazy
    You may think I'm mad
    But hang on to your seats
    And listen right here
    I'm gonna tell you something
    That'll burn your ear

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap

    I was born on the 7th of May
    I remember very well that awful day
    I was in my mother, curled up tight
    Though I have to say, it was as dark as night
    Nothing to do, didn't wanna breathe
    I was so happy, didn't want to leave
    Then I hear some people give a shout
    "One push, Mrs. Rosen, and he'll be out!"
    I'm telling you, that was a puzzle to me
    I shouted out, "How'd you know I'm a he?"
    Doctor shouted, "Good lord, he can talk!"
    I popped out my head, said, "Now watch me walk!"
    I juked and jived around that room
    Balam-bam-boola balam-ba-diddy-boom

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap

    When I was one, I swam the English Channel
    When I was two, I ate a soapy flannel
    When I was three, I started getting thinner
    When I was four, I ate the dog's dinner
    When I was five, I was in a band playing drums
    When I was six, I ate a bag of plums
    When I was seven, I robbed a bank with my sister
    When I was eight, I became prime minister
    When I was nine, I closed all the schools
    When I was ten, they made me king of the fools

    So that's what I am, that's what I be
    With an M, with an I, with a K, with an E
    That's what I am, that's what I be
    Mr. Mike, Mr. Michael, Mr. Rosen, Mr. Me

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap...

Commentary: |-
    <i>Undertale Wiki:</i>
    (<a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Flowey">Fandom</a>)
    Flowey's laugh is not a new asset and can be recognized in other media. It was originally a Warner Bros. sound effect mostly used in Pink Panther cartoons and has appeared in titles such as the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aBa-iQSkxc">Tomba!</a> and the Homestuck soundtrack [[track:the-lordling]], also by Toby Fox.
