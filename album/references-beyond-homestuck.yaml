    <i>AN APPLE DISASTER!!</i><br>That's the name of her song<br>And her name is Apple Girlington<br>She's the personification of<br>An apple
    This spell card is called <i>THE APPLE WIZARD OF MOUNT FUJI</i><br>It's part of important Japanese folk lore<br>The pre-battle dialogue goes like this:
    <i>You should taste my wonderful apples</i><br><i>No, sorry, I'm watching my weight recently</i><br><i>No!! You have to try the apples or I won't let you through!</i><br><i>Oh, well, I'll give you a diabetes won't I</i><br><i>[UNTRANSLATABLE JAPANESE IDIOM]</i>
    Then you have a weird chord change<br>Because it's a newer Touhou song
    Then they make a joke about apple pie

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    Bogey’s Theme, also written as fan music for Kid Radd.  Since Bogey was a basic enemy from Kid Radd’s game, I figured a simple “level 1” style theme would fit him.

Lyrics: |-
    (I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? The number I'm thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It's between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that's between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It's my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it for me? I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty, and that it's between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it? It's a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and get it? I'm thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won't you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won't you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I'm thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I'm thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won't you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don't grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I'm thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty. I'm thinking that the number is probably seven hundred and twenty. Won't you reach in and grab it for me? But I'm thinking of a number that is between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab a number that's between my buttocks? The number between four fifty and eight fifty is between my buttocks! The number seven hundred and twenty is between my buttocks! If you can reach in and grab this number that is between my buttocks, you can save a lot of money! The higher the number is between my buttocks, the more money you could save between my buttocks. I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. This number is the aforementioned number between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is, the better chance you have of saving a lot of buttocks on your credit report. I'm thinking of buttocks between my numbers. The numbers happen to be four fifty and eight fifty, and they are between my buttocks. My buttocks happen to be between the numbers of four fifty and eight fifty. This number is seven hundred and twenty. I'm thinking that the number seven hundred and twenty could save you a lot of money. Do you know why? It's between four fifty and eight fifty, and it's also within my buttocks. You can reach in and grab a free credit report, that could save you a lot of money. I'm thinking that it's between four fifty and eight fifty, and could save you a lot of money. Do you know what it is? It's my buttocks! That you can reach in between! And get a number! That is seven hundred and twenty! That I am thinking of right now. The number is seven hundred and twenty, and you can reach in between my buttocks and get it. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. I'm thinking you can reach in between my buttocks for a number that's between four fifty and eight fifty and my buttocks. Do you know what you can reach in between my buttocks to get? It's your free credit report, and it happens for me to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks if you so choose, to retrieve this number, which is seven hundred and twenty, which happens to be between my buttocks. Why don't you reach in between my buttocks? The higher that the number you reach in and grab in between my buttocks, the better chance you have at saving a lot of money, after you have reached in and grabbed a number, between my buttocks. I'm thinking though, that you might want to reach in and grab between my buttocks, in order to get a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty. The number that is between four fifty and eight fifty is less that eight fifty and greater than four fifty. And between my buttocks! The number happens to also be seven hundred and twenty, a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. But I'm thinking that this number is greater than four fifty. But is it less than eight fifty? It's seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be your free credit score. The higher the number, the greater chance you have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks, if you reach in and grab it between my buttocks. I'm thinking you can reach in and grab between my buttocks a number that is seven hundred and twenty, which just so happens to be my credit score. Or, you could grab a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? For me, it happens to be between my buttocks, and the number is seven hundred and twenty. Between my buttocks! You can reach in and grab a number between four fifty and eight fifty that happens so to be between my buttocks. If you grab this number that is between my buttocks, you can get a lot of money. Four fifty and eight fifty. These are the numbers that is has to be between. If you reach in and grab between my buttocks, you could save a lot of money. Your credit score could be saved a lot of. This could save you a lot of money, if you reach between my buttocks. I'm thinking this could save you a lot of money. If you reach in between my buttocks, you could save a lot of buttocks. Save a lot of buttocks in between my buttocks. Reach in between my buttocks and grab the number seven hundred and twenty. Save a lot of money if you grab in between my buttocks and grab a sember that it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. It's a number between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks, and you can reach in and grab your free credit score which is between four fifty and eight fifty it happens to be in between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, which is also between my buttocks. The numbers four fifty and eight fifty happen to be outside of seven hundred and twenty, which is in between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. Which happens to have the numbers four fifty and eight fifty as the boundaries of seven hundred and twenty. Seven hundred and twenty is a number between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and grab a number. This number is your free credit report, and it happens to be- OH GOD NO! NO! NOO! HELP ME! IT'S EVERYWHERE! YOU CAN REACH IN BETWEEN MY BUTTOCKS! HELP! EIGHT FIFTY! FOUR FIFTY!)

Lyrics: |-
    (Uh... Scott Stutzman... [pronounced 'Stootzman'])
    (It's pronounced 'Thompson'. Scott Thompson. No it's Stutzman.)
    (Okay. Stutzman. Not Stootzman but Stutzman. Okay.) (Stutzman. Stutzman. Stutzman.)
    (And, uh, he's our- my Songwriting 2 student from, uh, Spring Creek, and he's gonna play a little band, uh, ukulele, and...)
    (It feels perfect. Thank you.)
    (Does that sound good?) (Of course it sounds good.)
    (I don't know Scott's song title, you'll have to tell them.) (Oh, okay, well this uh, has a little bit of a story attached. Uh one of my favorite breakfast cereals of all time is... Fruity Pebbles. And I realized the other day that Fruity Pebbles doesn't have a slogan or a jingle associated with it. So what i did was I just wrote a short little jingle that they would probably love to use in one of their commercials. Uh the song is called... Fruity Pebbles Jingle.) [mild clapping] (Thank you I love America too.)

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning
    Those colorful enchanting little specks
    They make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning
    In a way they never do when I eat Chex

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'
    I shove 'em by the fistful in my trap
    They got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin
    And make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap

    Yeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation
    They're tiny tasty munchable and sweet
    I'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation
    And murder every other breakfast treat

    And the gallows will sway through the night
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    All cereals bow down in fright
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Sycophants and cowards flee
    From Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Captain Crunch on bended knee
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    The balance of the world's askew
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Promise revolutions new
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    What cereal 'mongst other things
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Stays crunchy in the blood of kings?
    It's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    (Alright, still goin'. Ridin' that Pebble train.)
    City-states and emirates and commonwealths and counties
    Imagine how they will react with glee
    As the early dawn reflects upon all nature's greatest bounty
    Of soybean oil and red dye number three

    Oh ministers and magistrates can't stop the people's yearning
    For the turning of the powers yet to be
    And presidents and potentates can't stop the fires burning
    As we cast their ivory towers to the sea

    And the creatures of the forest hark
    To Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Noble stag and yellow lark
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The innocence of children's eyes
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Will watch that Fruity flag rise
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    United we shall march along
    With Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Some shall die but we'll fight on
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The fife shall play its soaring note
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    We'll slit every dissenting throat
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    This vow for glory we must keep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Though God himself may turn and weep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Do not fear the cleansing flood
    Of Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    A breakfast table stained with blood
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    AAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    OOOOOooooooo.....

    (I really like Fruity Pebbles.)
    (Well thank you Scott. Thank goodness for comedians. You know? It lightens our day.)
    (It-that-it wasn't supposed to be funny.)

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    Gnarl’s Theme, also written for Kid Radd. Since Gnarl was the final boss of Radd’s game, it was obvious that his theme should sound like boss fight music.  It has a little of Radd’s theme mixed in there, since Radd and Gnarl are brothers (not a spoiler, we find that out pretty quickly in chapter 1).

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    The author contacted me to do music for the final comic; this is a recording of it.  it was originally in MIDI format, so it ended up sounding different on different computers (this is how it sounded on mine at the time). It uses the themes for Bogey and Sheena at the beginning, and was primarily Radd’s theme after that. Out of all of the music I wrote, this is the only one that wasn’t technically just “fan music”, but was actually official to the comic.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    As some of you might know, Problem Sleuth wasn’t the first animated webcomic that I wrote fan music for. Way back in the early 2000’s, I wrote some fan music for a webcomic called Kid Radd (original site is down, but there’s a mirror). The author liked it so much, he not only posted it on the fan section of the webpage, but later on when the comic ended, he contacted me about doing music for the final comic. An honor, as it was a great comic; it was like Wreck-It Ralph many years before Wreck-It Ralph.

    This first level's song is called Magical Hopalong Cassidy Station.
    This part of the song is just to remind you that it takes place in Japan, in case you forgot.
    This is where we have the sudden transition into the miniboss battle part of the song.
    <i>YOU ACTIVATED MY SPELL CARD, YUGI</i>
    Okay I'm flying toward the ends of the level now.
    Picking up some more uh, powerups.<br>I have not reached max power yet 'cuz it's the first level.

    <i>Mark J. Hadley:</i>
    Sheena’s Theme, written for Kid Radd. Sheena is Radd’s “girlfriend” that he has to rescue at the end of his game. Since that’s the only time she shows up in the game, it made sense that her music would sound like a winning game over theme.  Naturally, Radd’s theme is mixed in there too.

    <i>Solatrus:</i>
    Terra is one of a few tracks I managed to finish in 2009, and is also the first track that I started using my current logo in, however in a much earlier form.
    This song was originally intended to be used in a game, however, it never came to fruition.

Track: Beginning
# From Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse
# The original official release combines this track with several others from the same game for its inclusion on the CD, so it doesn't have a "canonical" duration. But it starts at 2:46 and fades out ending at 4:30, which is what's used for the duration here.
# Note that Castlevania III's NES release has a different rendition of the soundtrack from its original Famicom release, running on a different sound chip. They're essentially the same songs, but the Famicom original is what is listed here.

Lyrics: |-
    Here, here, here we go!

    So they're finally here, performing for you,
    If you know the words, you can join in too,
    Put your hands together, if you want to clap,
    As we take you through, this monkey rap!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!

    He's the leader of the bunch, you know him well,
    He's finally back to kick some tail,
    His Coconut Gun can fire in spurts,
    If he shoots ya, it's gonna hurt,
    He's bigger, faster, and stronger too,
    He's the first member of the D.K. crew!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    D.K., Donkey Kong is here!

    This Kong's got style, so listen up dudes,
    She can shrink in size, to suit her mood,
    She's quick and nimble when she needs to be,
    She can float through the air and climb up trees!
    If you choose her, you'll not choose wrong,
    With a skip and a hop, she's one cool Kong!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!

    He has no style, he has no grace,
    Th-th-th-this Kong has a funny face,
    He can handstand when he needs to,
    And stretch his arms out, just for you,
    Inflate himself just like a balloon,
    This crazy Kong just digs this tune!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    D.K., Donkey Kong is here!

    He's back again and about time too,
    And this time he's in the mood,
    He can fly real high with his jetpack on,
    With his pistols out, he's one tough Kong!
    He'll make you smile when he plays his tune,
    But Kremlings beware 'cause he's after you!

    Huh!
    D.K., Donkey Kong!
    Huh!

    Finally, he's here for you,
    It's the last member of the D.K. crew!
    This Kong's so strong, it isn't funny,
    Can make a Kremling cry out for mummy,
    Can pick up a boulder with relative ease,
    Makes crushing rocks seem such a breeze,
    He may move slow, he can't jump high,
    But this Kong's one hell of a guy!

    Huh!
    C'mon Cranky, take it to the fridge!

    W-w-w-walnuts. peanuts. pineapple smells.
    Grapes. melons. oranges and coconut shells!
    Ahh yeah!
    Walnuts, peanuts, pineapple smells,
    Grapes, melons, oranges and coconut shells!
    Ahh yeah!

    Don't you know it's time to raise our sails?
    It's freedom like you never knew

    Don't need bags, or a pass
    Say the word, I'll be there in a flash
    You could say my hat is off to you

    Oh, we can zoom all the way to the moon
    From this great wide wacky world
    Jump with me, grab coins with me
    Oh, yeah!

    It's time to jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)
    Jump up, don't be scared (Jump up, don't be scared)
    Jump up and your cares will soar away

    And if the dark clouds start to swirl (Dark clouds start to swirl)
    Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause
    I'll be your 1-UP girl

    So let's all jump up super high (Jump up super high)
    High up in the sky (High up in the sky)
    There's no power-up like dancing

    You know that you're my superstar (You're my superstar)
    No one else can take me this far
    I'm flipping the switch
    Get ready for this
    Oh, let's do the odyssey

    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, ya see!
    Odyssey, odyssey!

    Spin the wheel, take a chance
    Every journey starts a new romance
    A new world's calling out to you

    Take a turn, off the path
    Find a new addition to the cast
    You know that any captain needs a crew

    Take it in stride as you move side-to-side
    They're just different points of view
    Jump with me, grab coins with me
    Oh, yeah!

    Come on and jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)
    Jump without a care (Jump without a care)
    Jump up 'cause you know that I'll be there

    And if you find you're short on joy (Find you're short on joy)
    Don't fret, just don't forget that
    You're still our 1-UP boy

    So go on, straighten up your cap (Straighten up your cap)
    Let your toes begin to tap (Toes begin to tap)
    This rhythm is a power shroom

    Don't forget you're the superstar (You're the superstar)
    No one else could make it this far
    Put a comb through that 'stache
    Now you've got panache
    Oh, let's do the odyssey

    It's time to jump up in the air (Jump up in the air)
    Jump up, don't be scared (Jump up, don't be scared)
    Jump up and your cares will soar away

    And if the dark clouds start to swirl (Dark clouds start to swirl)
    Don't fear, don't shed a tear, 'cause
    I'll be your 1-UP girl

    Now listen, all you boys and girls (All you boys and girls)
    All around the world (All around the world)
    Don't be afraid to get up and move

    You know that we're all superstars (We're all superstars)
    We're the ones who made it this far
    Put a smile on that face
    There's no time to waste
    So, let's do the odyssey

Lyrics: |-
    Say "Alright!" (Alright!)
    Say "Oh yeah!" (Oh yeah!)
    Whatcha gonna do?  (Whatcha gonna do!)
    (I gotta believe!) I gotta believe!

    If you thought your dreams were fulfilled before
    You need to come on back, Jack
    Look who walked in the door
    It's Parappa The Rapper, and my name is Pos
    I'm known to emcee for free or a cost
    If you be at the mosque, synagogue, or church
    Drop to your knees and pray for Parappa The Rapper
    To save the day and make you scream hooray!
    Just clap on time, 'cause it's time to play

    I know you're slick and smooth, cool with an attitude
    On the right track, leader of the pack
    Kickin' back, never looking back
    You know my words won't satisfy
    What I have now, deep inside of me (Inside of me)
    And all I need is much security

    When you're needed for a mission, he got your back
    Sure to have a cool time, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
    So come on and let's go

    We are the concentrated Vitamin D, with the title
    Hookin' it up, speedy quick, like noodles to cup
    It ain't nothin' for the one man
    Buttin' to move somethin'
    Runnin' par rappin' through laps
    Hurdlin' raps
    And just when you thought your game was dead
    Well, we got you cookin' up rhymes all in your think kettle
    Proceed and click the next level for fun, player (Oh, oh yeah)
    Play ya game, player number one 

    True love that speaks the truth
    You know it'll help me through
    In the cold night
    In the morning, all night
    Or even in a fight
    You know you should come home to me
    We can have fun until the early morning light

    Aw yeah
    Aw yeah, oh
    Oh, oh
    Oh

    Here to serve up a dish like Sunny Chan
    You know I'm the man
    Here to have fun
    Wanna have a taste?
    Here, have some
    Servin' up O's by the oodles
    Oh, I forgot
    Parappa The Rapper, he don't like noodles
    We like eating snapper that's red
    Freestyle from the top of the head
    Yo, Parappa got skill
    Why don't you give it try, see what you can build
    Tasty like fruit that's peeled
    Watch your heels, you might slip and fall
    And if you do, you know who to call (Who?)
    It's Parappa the Rapper and De La, y'all

    You and me can walk together
    And down the road forever
    And smell and touch the treasures of life
    Every day
    Love and hate are face to face
    And good and bad are back to back
    Every day, uh huh
    Uh huh, uh huh, oh yeah, yay

    Switch on your 36 inches
    You in the boob tube, trapped deep
    'Til the game watch you sleep
    Overdosed on moves taught by the sensei
    Your timing's all off, tiger
    You in the little leagues
    Striking out a De La joint
    Book a session for the Plugs and PJ
    To come train the camp, y'all
    Mooselini, graffiti tag and plug dose (Dose, dose, dose)
    Game over, I'm ghost (Ghost, ghost)

    When you're needed for a mission, he got your back
    Sure to have a cool time, man, that's a fact
    Yo, he's a good friend, never ever a foe
    Come on, everybody, saddle up and let's go

    All my people say "Alright!" (Alright!)
    Yeah, that was good, now let me hear you say "Oh yeah!" (Oh yeah!) (Oh yeah)
    Now let me hear you say "Whatcha gonna do?" (Whatcha gonna do?)
    Come on, y'all, let me hear you say "I gotta believe!" (I gotta believe!) (Believe...)
    Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yay

Lyrics: |-
    Wash away the anger

    Here I stand beneath the warm and soothing rain
    The droplets falling gently down on the terrain
    Wash away the sorrow all the stains of time
    But there’s no memory it’s only dry inside

    In the mud and sinking deeper
    Into a peaceful life

    And it will come like a flood of pain
    Pouring down on me
    And it will not let up
    Until the end is here
    And it will come through the darkest day
    In my final hour
    And it will never rest until the clouds are clear
    Until it finds my dreams have disappeared

    My dreams disappear

Track: Theme of Eastern Story
# This doesn't exactly have an "official in-game release"... but it wasn't exactly composed for one game either, serving more as a theme for the Touhou series. The duration here is pulled from Akyu's Untouched Score vol.5.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    Originally found in Mario Paint and known as 'Mario Paint song', it was its discovery in Animal Crossing as a secret track you could only hear by requesting 'K.K. Song' from K.K. Slider that clued fans in as to its true nature, as the character is based on Nintendo composer Kazumi Totaka. Versions of this song have been hidden in almost every game he has been involved in, usually by idling in some specific part of the game for several minutes.

Lyrics: |-
    I saved every letter you wrote me
    From the moment I read them
    I knew you were mine
    You said you were mine
    I thought you were mine

    Do you know what Angelica said
    When we saw your first letter arrive?
    She said
    Be careful with that one, love
    He will do what it takes to survive

    You and your words flooded my senses
    Your sentences left me defenseless
    You built me palaces out of paragraphs
    You built cathedrals

    I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
    I'm searching and scanning for answers
    In every line
    For some kind of sign
    And when you were mine
    The world seemed to
    Burn
    Burn

    You published the letters she wrote you
    You told the whole world how you brought
    This girl into our bed
    In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
    Do you know what Angelica said
    When she read what you'd done?
    She said
    You have married an Icarus
    He has flown too close to the sun

    You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
    Your sentences border on senseless
    And you are paranoid in every paragraph
    How they perceive you
    You, you, you…

    I'm erasing myself from the narrative
    Let future historians wonder how Eliza
    Reacted when you broke her heart
    You have torn it all apart
    I am watching it burn
    Watching it burn

    The world has no right to my heart
    The world has no place in our bed
    They don't get to know what I said
    I'm burning the memories
    Burning the letters that might have redeemed you

    You forfeit all rights to my heart
    You forfeit the place in our bed
    You sleep in your office instead
    With only the memories
    Of when you were mine
    I hope that you burn

Lyrics: |-
    There's a calm surrender
    To the rush of day
    When the heat of a rolling wind
    Can be turned away

    An enchanted moment
    And it sees me through
    It's enough for this restless warrior
    Just to be with you

    And can you feel the love tonight?
    It is where we are
    It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
    That we got this far

    And can you feel the love tonight
    How it's laid to rest?
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Believe the very best

    There's a time for everyone
    If they only learn
    That the twisting kaleidoscope
    Moves us all in turn

    There's a rhyme and reason
    To the wild outdoors
    When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
    Beats in time with yours

    And can you feel the love tonight?
    It is where we are
    It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
    That we got this far

    And can you feel the love tonight
    How it's laid to rest?
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Believe the very best
    It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
    Believe the very best

    Here in the garden
    Let's play a game
    I'll show you how it's done

    Here in the garden
    Stand very still
    This'll be so much fun

    And then she smiled
    That's what I'm after
    The smile in her eyes
    The sound of her laughter

    Happy to listen
    Happy to play
    Happily watching her drift
    Away
    
    Happily waiting
    All on my own
    Under the endless sky

    Counting the seconds
    Standing alone
    As thousands of years go by

    Happily wondering
    Night after night
    Is this how it works?
    Am I doing it right?

    Happy to listen
    Happy to stay
    Happily watching her drift
    Away
    
    You keep on turning pages
    For people who don't care, people who don't care
    About you

    And still it takes you ages
    To see that no one's there, see that no one's there
    See that no one's there, everyone's gone on
    Without you
    
    Finally something
    Finally news
    About how the story ends

    She doesn't exist now
    Survived by her son
    And all of her brand new friends
    
    Isn't that lovely?
    Isn't that cool?
    And isn't that cruel?
    And aren't I a fool to have
    Happily listened
    Happy to stay
    Happily watching her drift
    Drift
    Drift
    Away

    I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in
    They're hypnotized by the way I'm walking
    I've got them dazzled like a stage magician
    When I point they look, and when I talk they listen, well

    Everybody needs a friend
    And I've got you and you and you
    So many I can't even name them
    Can you blame me? I'm too famous

    Haven't you noticed that I'm a star?
    I'm coming into view as the world is turning

    Baby 'cause you know that you're everything
    Good in my life

    And tell me now
    How do I live without you?
    I want to know
    How do I breathe without you?
    If you ever go
    How do I ever
    Ever survive?
    How do I, how do I
    Oh how do I live?

    How do I live
    Without you baby

    How do I live...

- I'm A Man Of Constant Sorrow
Lyrics: |-
    (In constant sorrow all through his days)

    I am a man of constant sorrow
    I've seen trouble all my days
    I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
    The place where I was born and raised
    (The place where he was born and raised)

    For six long years I've been in trouble
    No pleasure here on Earth I've found
    For in this world I'm bound to ramble
    I have no friends to help me now
    (He has no friends to help him now)

    It's fare thee well, my old true lover
    I never expect to see you again
    For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad
    Perhaps I'll die upon this train
    (Perhaps he'll die upon this train)

    You can bury me in some deep valley
    For many years where I may lay
    And you may learn to love another
    While I am sleeping in my grave
    (While he is sleeping in his grave)

    Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
    My face you never will see no more
    But there is one promise that is given
    I'll meet you on God's golden shore
    (He'll meet you on God's golden shore)

    I could stay awake just to hear you breathin'
    Watch you smile while you are sleeping
    While you're far away and dreaming
    I could spend my life in this sweet surrender
    I could stay lost in this moment forever
    Where every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep
    'Cause I'd miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing
    'Cause even when I dream of you (Even when I dream)
    The sweetest dream would never do
    I'd still miss you, babe
    And I don't wanna miss a thing

    Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating
    And I'm wondering what you're dreaming
    Wonderin' if it's me you're seeing
    Then I kiss your eyes and thank God we're together
    And I just wanna stay with you
    In this moment forever
    Forever and ever

    I don't wanna close my eyes
    I don't wanna fall asleep

    I don't wanna miss one smile
    I don't wanna miss one kiss
    Well, I just wanna be with you
    Right here with you, just like this
    I just wanna hold you close
    I feel your heart so close to mine
    And just stay here in this moment
    For all the rest of time
    Yeah, (Yeah) Yeah, (Yeah) Yeah!

    Don't wanna close my eyes
    Don't wanna fall asleep

    But her friendship comes through subliminal
    Lapis Lazuli, you fled into the bottom of the sea
    Lapis Lazuli, you were so mad, but then you came around to me

    Somewhere over the rainbow

    There's a land that I heard of
    Once in a lullaby

    Somewhere over the rainbow
    Skies are blue
    And the dreams that you dare to dream
    Really do come true

    Someday I'll wish upon a star
    And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
    Where troubles melt like lemon drops
    Away above the chimney tops
    That's where you'll find me

    Somewhere over the rainbow
    Bluebirds fly
    Birds fly over the rainbow
    Why, then, oh, why can't I?

    If happy little bluebirds fly
    Beyond the rainbow
    Why, oh, why can't I?

    (Maybe he's right, maybe there is something the matter with me)
    (I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad)

    Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
    Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
    Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
    The girl who has everything?

    Look at this trove, treasures untold
    How many wonders can one cavern hold?
    Looking around here you'd think
    (Sure) she's got everything

    I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
    I've got whozits and whatzits galore
    You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
    But who cares? No big deal
    I want more

    I wanna be where the people are
    I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
    Walking around on those
    (What do you call 'em? Oh, feet)

    Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
    Legs are required for jumping, dancing
    Strolling along down the
    (What's that word again?)
    Street

    Up where they walk, up where they run
    Up where they stay all day in the sun
    Wanderin' free, wish I could be
    Part of that world

    What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
    What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
    Betcha on land, they understand
    Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
    Bright young women, sick of swimmin'
    Ready to stand

    And ready to know what the people know
    Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
    What's a fire and why does it, what's the word
    Burn?

    When's it my turn?
    Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
    Out of the sea, wish I could be
    Part of that world

    Why are there so many
    Songs about rainbows
    And what's on the other side?
    Rainbows are visions
    But only illusions
    And rainbows have nothing to hide

    So we've been told and some choose to believe it
    I know they're wrong wait and see
    Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
    The lovers, the dreamers and me

    Who said that every wish
    Would be heard and answered
    When wished on the morning star?
    Somebody thought of that
    And someone believed it
    Look what it's done so far

    What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
    And what do we think we might see?
    Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
    The lovers, the dreamers and me

    All of us under its spell
    We know that it's probably magic

    Have you been half asleep
    And have you heard voices?
    I've heard them calling my name
    Is this the sweet sound
    That calls the young sailors?
    The voice might be one and the same

    I've heard it too many times to ignore it
    It's something that I'm supposed to be
    Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
    The lovers, the dreamers and me

Lyrics: |-
    I couldn't take it, couldn't stand another minute
    Couldn't bear another day without you in it
    All of the joy that I had known for all my life
    Was stripped away from me the minute that you died

    To have you in my life was all I ever wanted
    But now without you I'm a soul forever haunted
    Can't help but feel that I had taken you for granted
    No way in hell that I can ever comprehend this

    I wasn't dreaming when they told me you were gone
    I was wide awake and feeling that they had to be wrong
    How could you leave me when you swore that you would stay?
    Now I'm trapped inside a nightmare every single f'ing day

    It's like a movie, but there's not a happy ending
    Every scene fades black, and there's no pretending
    This little fairy tale doesn't seem to end well
    There's no knight in shining armor who will wake me from the spell

    I know you didn't plan this
    You tried to do what's right
    But in the middle of this madness
    I'm the one you left to win this fight

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you

    I know you're broken down by anger and by sadness
    You feel I left you in a world that's full of madness
    Wish I could talk to you, if only for a minute
    Make you understand the reasons why I did it

    I wanna tell you that you're all that ever mattered
    Want you to know that, for eternity, I'm shattered
    I tried so hard just to protect you, but I failed to
    And in a prison of abandonment I've jailed you

    I never planned that I would leave you there alone
    I was sure that I would see you when I made it back home
    And all the times I swore that it would be okay
    Now I'm nothing but a liar, and you're thrown into the fray

    This bedtime story ends with misery ever after
    The pages are torn, and there's no final chapter
    I didn't have a choice, I did what I had to do
    I made a sacrifice, but forced a bigger sacrifice on you

    I know you've lived a nightmare
    I caused you so much pain
    But, baby, please don't do what I did
    I don't want you to waste your life in vain

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you.

    You're not the only one who needed me; I thought you understood
    You were the one I needed, and you left me as I always feared you would
    Would I change it if I could?
    Both voices: It doesn't matter how
    The petals scatter now
    Every nightmare just discloses
    It's your blood that's red like roses
    And no matter what I do
    Nothing ever takes the place of you

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you

Lyrics: |-
    This is Garnet
    Back together
    And I'm never going down at the hands of the likes of you because I'm so much better
    And every part of me is saying "Go get her"

    The two of us ain't gonna follow your rules
    Come at me without any of your fancy tools
    Let's go, just me and you
    Let's go, just one on two

    Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able
    Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
    I can see you hate the way we intermingle
    But I think you're just mad 'cause you're single

    And you're not gonna stop what we made together
    We are gonna stay like this forever
    If you break us apart, we'll just come back newer
    And we'll always be twice the gem that you are

    I am made
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of

    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    Lo-o-o-o-ove

    This is who we are
    This is who I am
    And if you think you can stop me
    Then you need to think again

    'Cause I am a feeling
    And I will never end
    And I won't let you hurt my planet
    And I won't let you hurt my friends

    Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able.
    Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
    I know you think I'm not something you're afraid of
    'Cause you think that you've seen what I'm made of

    But I am even more than the two of them
    Everything they care about is what I am
    I am their fury, I am their patience
    I am a conversation

    I am made
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    And it's stronger than you

    L-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    L-o-o-o-ove
    And it's stronger than you

    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    And it's stronger than you

    Lo-o-o-o-ove

Lyrics: |-
    It's... Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
    If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

    Because I was afraid to speak
    When I was just a lad
    Me father gave me nose a tweak
    And told me I was bad
    But then one day I learned a word
    That saved me achin' nose
    The biggest word you ever heard
    And this is how it goes

    Oh! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
    If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

    He traveled all around the world
    And everywhere he went,
    He'd use his word and all would say
    There goes a clever gent

    When Dukes and Maharajas pass
    the time of day with me
    I say me special word and then
    They ask me out to tea

    Oh! Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious
    If you say it loud enough, you'll always sound precocious
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay
    Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay!

    (You know, you can say it backwards, which is dociousaliexpilistic-fragilcalirupus, but that's going a bit too far, don't you think?)
    (Indubitably.)

    So when the cat has got your tongue
    There's no need for dismay (Hear hear!)
    Just summon up this word and then
    You've got a lot to say
    But better use it carefully
    Ir it could change your life

    (For example...)
    (Yes?)
    (One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife! Ow! And a lovely thing she is, too!)

    She's... Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!
    Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!

Lyrics: |-
    Maybe you've heard of a terrible place
    Where the scoundrels of Paris collect in a lair
    Maybe you've heard of that mythical place
    Called the Court of Miracles
    (Hello, you're there!)

    Where the lame can walk
    And the blind can see
    But the dead don't talk
    So you won't be around to reveal what you've found

    We have a method for spies and intruders
    Rather like hornets protecting their hive
    Here in the Court of Miracles
    Where it's a miracle if you get out alive!

    Justice is swift in the Court of Miracles
    I am the lawyers and judge all in one
    We like to get the trial over with quickly
    Because it's the sentence that's really the fun!

    (Any last words?)
    [muffled speech]
    (That's what they all say.)

    Now that we've seen all the evidence
    (Wait! I object!) (Overruled!)
    (I object!) (Quiet!)
    (Dang.)

    We find you totally innocent
    Which is the worst crime of all
    So you're going to hang!

Lyrics: |-
    Krrr, amadou!

    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!

    In case you forgot or fell off, I'm still hot, knock your shell off
    My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off
    The franchise, doing big business, I live this
    It's automatic I win this, oh, you hear those horns, you finished

    A soldier, and I stay under you fighting
    Plus I'm storming on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning
    Ain't no way you breaking me, kid, I'm harder than nails
    Plus I keep it on lock like I'm part of the jail

    I'm slaughtering stale competition, I got the whole block wishing
    They could run with my division but they gone fishing
    With no bait, kid, your boy hold weight
    I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate

    In any weather, I'm never better, your boy's so hot
    You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
    If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan
    Lay yo' ass down for the three-second tan

    Krrr, amadou!
    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!

    Yeah, uh
    It's gonna be what it's gon' be
    Five pounds of courage buddy, beige tint pants with a gold T
    Uh, it's a war dance and victory step
    A raw stance is a gift when you insist it's my rep
    John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so and talk about
    The bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough, though
    Aimin' guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
    When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
    See what happens when the ice age melt
    You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
    I rock a timepiece by Benny, if any
    The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
    A man's measured by the way that he thinks
    Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
    I spent twenty-plus years seeking knowledge of self
    So, for now, Marc Predka's living live for wealth

    Krrr, amadou!
    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!
    Your time is up, my time is now
    You can't see me, my time is now
    It's the franchise, boy, I'm shining now
    You can't see me, my time is now!

    If you're evil, and you're on the rise
    You can count on the four of us taking you down
    'Cause we're good and evil never beats us
    We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

    We are the Crystal Gems
    We'll always save the day
    And if you think we can't
    We'll always find a way

    That's why the people of this world believe in
    Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, and Steven!

    If you could only know
    What we really are
    When we arrived on Earth
    From out beyond your star

    We were amazed to find
    Your beauty and your worth
    And we will protect your kind
    And we will protect your Earth
    And we will protect your Earth
    And we will protect you!

    I will fight for the place where I'm free
    To live together and exist as me
    I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz
    And everything that she believed in

    I will fight for the world I was made in
    The Earth is everything I've ever known
    I will fight to be everything
    that everybody wants me to be when I'm grown!    
    The odds are against us, this won't be easy
    But we're not going to do it alone!

    Aah haa haa, aah haa haa
    Aah ha aah ha, aah haa haa
    Aah haa haa, aah haa haa
    Aah haa haa haa haa haa haa haa haaaaa

    Why would you want to be here?
    What do you ever see here
    That doesn't make you feel worse than you do?
    And tell me, what's the use of feeling, Blue?

    Why would you want to employ her
    Subjects that destroyed her?
    Why keep up her silly zoo?
    Oh tell me what's the use of feeling, Blue?

    An army has a use, they can go and fight a war
    A Sapphire has a use, she can tell you what it's for
    An Agate terrifies, a Lapis terraforms
    Where's their Diamond when they need her Blue?
    You've got to be a leader Blue!

    Yes, of course we still love her
    And we're always thinking of her
    But now there's nothing we can do

    So tell me
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling Blue?

    Ohh
    How can you stand to be here with it all (Here with it all)
    Drowning in all this regret
    Wouldn't you rather forget her?

    Ohh
    Won't it be grand to get rid of it all? (Rid of it all)
    Let's make a plan of attack
    Start looking forward and stop looking back

    Ohh
    Yes of course, we still love her
    And we're always thinking of her
    Don't you know I miss her too?

    But tell me
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm

Lyrics: |-
    Now this is a story all about how
    My life got flipped turned upside down
    And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

    In West Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground is where I spent most of my days
    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
    And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school

    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"

    I begged and pleaded with her day after day
    But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
    She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
    I put my Walkman on and said I might as well kick it!

    First class, yo, this is bad
    Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
    Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
    Hmm, this might be all right

    But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
    Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
    I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
    I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air!

    Well uh
    The plane landed and when I came out
    There was a dude, looked like a cop, standing there with my name out
    I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
    I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

    I whistled for a cab and when it came near
    The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
    If anything I could say that this cab was rare
    But I thought "Nah forget it, yo holmes to Bel-Air!"

    I, pulled
    Up to a house about seven or eight
    And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes, smell ya later!"
    I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
    To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air!

    You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
    You really are a heel
    You're as cuddly as a cactus, you're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
    You're a bad banana with a... greasy black peel!

    You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
    Your heart's an empty hole
    Your brain is full of spiders, you've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
    I wouldn't touch you with a... thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole!

    You're a vile one, Mr. Grinch
    You have termites in your smile
    You have all the tender sweetness of a seasick crocodile, Mr. Grinch
    (Given a choice between the two of you I'd take..)
    The seasick crocodile!

    You're a foul one, Mr. Grinch
    You're a nasty-wasty skunk
    Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk, Mr. Grinch
    (The three words that best describe you are as follows, and I quote:)
    Stink, stank, stunk!

    You're a rotter, Mr. Grinch
    You're the king of sinful sots
    Your heart's a dead tomato splotched with moldy purple spots, Mr. Grinch
    (Your soul is an appalling dump heap overflowing with the most disgraceful assortment of deplorable rubbish imaginable, mangled up in...)
    Tangled up knots!

    You nauseate me, Mr. Grinch
    With a nauseous super naus
    You're a crooked dirty jockey and you drive a crooked hoss, Mr. Grinch
    (You're a three decker sauerkraut and toadstool sandwich...)

Lyrics: |-
    Way down in the Congoland
    Lived a happy chimpanzee
    She loved a monkey with a long tail
    Lordy, how she loved him

    Each night he would find her there
    Swinging in the coconut tree
    And the monkey gay
    At the break of day
    Loved to hear his Chimpie say

    Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Said the Chimpie to the Monk
    Baba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Said the Monkey to the Chimp

    All night long they'd chatter away
    All day long there were happy and gay
    Swinging and singing in their hunky-monkey way

    Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Means "Monk, I love but you"
    Baba daba dab in monkey talk
    Means "Chimp, I love you, too"

    Then the big baboon one night in June
    He married them and very soon
    They went upon their aba daba honeymoon

    Well, you should have heard that band
    Play upon their wedding day
    Each Chimp and Monkey had nutshells
    Lordy, how they played them

    And now it is every night
    High up in the coconut tree
    It's the same old thing
    With the same old swing
    When the Monk and Chimpie sing

    Aba daba daba daba daba daba dab
    Said the Chimpie to the Monk
    Ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
    Said the Monkey to the Chimp

    All night long they'd chatter away
    All day long there were happy and gay
    Swinging and singing in their hunky-monkey way

    Aba daba daba daba doodly daba dab
    Means "Monk, I love but you"
    Baba daba dab in monkey talk
    Means "Chimp, I love you, too"

    And one day when both made man and wife
    They shouted out "This am the life"
    Returning from their aba daba honeymoon

    The provided lyrics are the most common version of this French nursery rhyme, and are a parody of "La Confidence naïve", a 1774 poem that was the first known publication of the melody set to words. The tune itself was first published in 1761 and is an anonymous pastoral song believed to date back to the 1740s. This melody forms the basis of not only the [[track:alphabet-song]], but also other nursery rhymes like "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" and "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep".

    There's a charming Irish lady with a roguish winning way
    Who has kept my heart a-bumping and a-jumping night and day
    She's a flower of Killarney with a Tipperary smile
    She's the best that ever came from Erin's Isle
    And I find myself a-singing all the while

    Bedelia, I want to steal ya
    Bedelia, I love you so
    I'll be your Chauncey Oilcloth

    Oh Bedelia, elia, elia
    I've made up my mind to steal ya, steal ya, steal ya
    Bedelia dear!

    If you love me, Bedelia, half as much as I love you
    There is nothing in this world can ever cut our love in two
    I will give you all my money on the day that we are wed
    I will cook for you and even bake the bread
    And I'll even bring your breakfast up to bed

    Bedelia, I want to steal ya
    Bedelia, I love you so
    I'll be your Chauncey Oilcloth

As with most folk music, it evolved from a shifting amalgamation of various earlier melodies— one notable one being a 1761 melody by Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It's since spread in a variety of forms throughout eastern Europe, and in the 21st century, through China, Korea, and most importantly Japan, where it became a popular children's song. Lyrics here are based on a 19th century songbook.

Lyrics: |-
    Deck the hall with boughs of holly
    Falalalala lala lala!
    'Tis the season to be jolly
    Falalalala lala lala!
    Fill the meadcup, drain the barrel (<i>Alt:</i> Don we now our gay apparel)
    Falala lalala la la la!
    Troul the ancient Christmas carol
    Falalalala lala lala!

    See the flowing bowl before us (<i>Alt:</i> See the blazing yule before us)
    Falalalala lala lala!
    Strike the harp, and join in chorus
    Falalalala lala lala!
    Follow me in merry measure
    Falala lalala la la la!
    While I sing of beauty's treasure (<i>Alt:</i> While I tell of Christmas treasure)
    Falalalala lala lala!

    Fast away the old year passes
    Falalalala lala lala!
    Hail the new, ye lads and lasses
    Falalalala lala lala!
    Laughing quaffing all together (<i>Alt:</i> Sing we joyous all together)
    Falala lalala la la la!
    Heedless of the wind and weather
    Falalalala lala lala!

    The alternate lyrics, of unknown provenance, were first known to have been published in 1877, 15 years after the original English-language lyrics. By far the most popular variation of the song, they remove all reference to alcohol consumption.

Lyrics: |-
    I am a man of constant sorrow
    I've seen trouble all of my days
    I'll bid farewell to old Kentucky
    The place where I was born and raised

    Oh, six long year I've been blind, friends
    My pleasures here on earth are done
    In this world I have to ramble

    So fare you well my own true lover
    I fear I'll never see you again
    For I am bound to ride the Northern railroad
    Perhaps I'll die upon the train

    Oh, you may bury me in some deep valley
    For many year there I may lay
    Oh, when you're dreaming while you're slumbering
    While I am sleeping in the clay

    Oh, fare you well to my native country
    The place where I have loved so well
    For I have all kinds of trouble
    In this vain world no tongue can tell

    Dear friends, although I may be a stranger
    My face you may never see no more
    But there is a promise that is given
    Where we can meet on that beautiful shore
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    "Farewell Song" was first published in a self-made songbook "Songs Song by R.D. BURNETT. The blind man. Monticello - - - Kentucky." in 1913. Those original lyrics are printed here verbatim, with the exception of adjustments to punctuation. However, later in life Dick Burnett himself was unsure of whether he composed the song entirely by himself or drew upon other works. Research has found tentative roots in hymns and folk songs from Kentucky and Virginia throughout the 19th century; as a traveling street performer Dick knew a vast amount of such works.

    While the song was first recorded in 1927 by Dick, Columbia Records did not release the recording, making Emry Arthur's 1928 recording the earliest. It is this version that is linked here, and this version that first adopted the name "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow" which the song is now commonly known as.

Lyrics: |-
    Frosty the Snowman was a jolly happy soul
    With a corn cob pipe and a button nose
    And his eyes made out of coal

    Frosty the Snowman made the children laugh and play
    And weren't they surprised when before their eyes
    He came to life that day

    There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
    For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around, oh

    Frosty the Snowman was as live as he could be
    And the children say he could laugh and play
    Just the same as you and me

    Frosty the Snowman knew the sun was hot that day
    So he said: Let's run and we'll have fun
    Before I melt away

    So down to the village with a broom stick in his hand
    Running here and there all around the square
    Saying, 'Catch me if you can!'

    He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop
    And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler, 'Stop!'

    For Frosty the Snowman had to hurry on his way
    But he waved goodbye saying: Don't you cry
    I'll be back again, someday

    There must have been some magic in that old silk hat they found
    For when they placed it on his head, he began to dance around, oh

    Frosty the Snowman was as live as he could be
    And the children say he could laugh and play
    Just the same as you and me

    Dam-pe-dip-dam-dam, dam-pe-dip-dam-dam
    Look at Frosty go!
    Dam-pe-dip-dam-dam, dam-pe-dip-dam-dam
    Over the hills of snow!

Lyrics: |-
    God rest you merry, gentlemen
    Let nothing you dismay
    Remember Christ our Savior
    Was born on Christmas Day
    To save us all from Satan's power
    When we were gone astray

    O tidings of comfort and joy
    Comfort and joy
    O tidings of comfort and joy

    In Bethlehem, in Jewry
    This blessed babe was born
    And laid within a manger
    Upon this blessed morn
    The which his mother Mary
    Did nothing did take in scorn

    O tidings of comfort and joy
    Comfort and joy
    O tidings of comfort and joy

    From God our heavenly Father
    A blessed angel came
    And unto certain shepherds
    Brought tidings of the same
    How that in Bethlehem was born
    The Son of God by Name

    O tidings of comfort and joy
    Comfort and joy
    O tidings of comfort and joy

    Alas my love, ye do me wrong
    To cast me off discourteously
    And I have loved you so long
    Delighting in your company

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    I have been ready at your hand
    To grant what ever you would crave
    I have both waged life and land
    Your love and good-will for to have

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    I bought thee kerchers to thy head
    That wre wrought fine and gallantly
    I kept thee both at board and bed
    Which cost my purse well favouredly

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    I bought thee petticoats of the best
    The cloth so fine as fine might be
    I gave thee jewels for thy chest
    And all this cost I spent on thee

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy smock of silk, both fair and white
    With gold embroidered gorgeously
    Thy petticoat of sendal right
    And these I bought thee gladly

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy girdle of gold so red
    With pearls bedecked sumptuously
    The like no other lasses had
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy purse and eke thy gay gilt knows
    Thy pincase gallant to the eye
    No better wore the burgess' wife
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy crimson stockings all of silk
    With gold all wrought above the knee
    Thy pumps as white as was the milk
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy gown was of the grassy green
    Thy sleeves of satin hanging by
    Which made thee be our harvest queen
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Thy garters fringed with the gold
    And silver aglets hanging by
    Which made thee blithe for to behold
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    My gayest gelding I thee gave
    To ride wherever liked thee
    No lady ever was so brave
    And yet tho wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    My men were clothed all in green
    And they did ever wait on thee
    All this was gallant to be seen
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    They set thee up, they took thee down
    They served thee with humility
    Thy foot might not once touch the ground
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    For every morning when thou rose
    I sent thee dainties orderly
    To cheer thy stomach from all woes
    And yet thou wouldst not love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    And who did pay for all this gear
    That thou didst spend when pleased thee?
    Even I that am rejected here
    And thou disdainst to love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Well I will pray to God on high
    That thou my constancy mayst seen
    And that yet once before I die
    Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves

    Greensleeves now, farewell, adieu
    God I pray to prosper thee
    For I am still thy lover true
    Come once again and love me

    Greensleeves was all my joy
    Greensleeves was my delight
    Greensleeves was my heart of gold
    And who but Lady Greensleeves
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The first known versions of Greensleeves date from the 1580. Two versions of the ballad were registered on the same day, one as "A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves" and another as "Ye Ladie Greene Sleeves answere to Donkyn hir frende", but the tune certainly predates these versions and authors. There have been countless variations of the lyrics and other lyrics set to the tune, but its association with Christmas came at a later date. The provided lyrics are from the 1584 publication "A Handful of Pleasant Delights", where it was known as "A New Courtly Sonnet of the Lady Green Sleeves. To the new tune of Green Sleeves."

    I've made some effort to update the spelling to modern standards, but don't blame me if some verses don't rhyme; blame the Great Vowel Shift.

    Good King Wenceslas look'd out
    On the Feast of Stephen
    When the snow lay round about
    Deep, and crisp, and even
    Brightly shone the moon that night
    Though the frost was cruel
    When a poor man came in sight
    Gath'ring winter fuel

    Hither, page, and stand by me
    If thou know'st, telling
    Yonder peasant who is he?
    Where and what his dwelling?
    Sire, he lives a good league hence
    Underneath the mountain
    Right against the forest fence
    By Saint Agnes' fountain

    Bring me flesh, and bring me wine
    Bring me pine logs hither
    Thou and I will see him dine
    When we bear them thither
    Page and monarch forth they went
    Forth they went together
    Through the rude wind's wild lament
    And the bitter weather

    Sire, the night is darker now
    And the wind blows stronger
    Fails my heart I know not how
    I can go no longer
    Mark my footsteps, good my page
    Tread thou in them boldly
    Thou shalt find the winter's rage
    Freeze thy blood less coldly

    In his master's steps he trod
    Where the snow lay dinted
    Heat was in the very sod
    Which the Saint had printed
    Therefore, Christian men, be sure
    Wealth or rank possessing
    Ye who now will bless the poor
    Shall yourselves find blessing

    Oh, the weather outside is frightful
    But the fire is so delightful
    And since we've no place to go
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

    It doesn't show signs of stoppin'
    And I've brought some corn for poppin'
    The lights are turned down low
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

    When we finally kiss good night
    How I'll hate going out in a storm
    But if you'll really hold me tight
    All the way home I'll be warm

    The fire is slowly dyin'
    And my dear, we're still goodbyin'
    As long as you love me so
    Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

    When we finally kiss good night
    How I'll hate to go out in a storm
    But if you'll really hold me tight
    All the way home I'll be warm

    The fire is slowly dyin'
    And my dear, we're still goodbyin'

Lyrics: |-
    Magnificat anima mea Dominum (<i>My soul doth magnify the Lord</i>)
    Et exultavit spiritus meus in Deo salutari meo (<i>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour</i>)
    Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae (<i>For he hath regarded: the lowliness of his handmaiden</i>)
    Ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes (<i>For behold, from henceforth: all generations shall call me blessed</i>)

    Quia fecit mihi magna qui potens est, et sanctum nomen ejus (<i>For he that is mighty hath magnified me: and holy is his Name</i>)
    Et misericordia ejus a progenie in progenies timentibus eum (<i>And his mercy is on them that fear him: throughout all generations</i>)
    Fecit potentiam in bracchio suo (<i>He hath shewed strength with his arm</i>)
    Dispersit superbos mente cordis sui (<i>He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts</i>)

    Deposuit potentes de sede, et exaltavit humiles (<i>He hath put down the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the humble and meek</i>)
    Esurientes implevit bonis, et divites dimisit inanes (<i>He hath filled the hungry with good things: and the rich he hath sent empty away</i>)
    Suscepit Israel, puerum suum, recordatus misericordiae suae (<i>He remembering his mercy hath holpen his servant Israel</i>)
    Sicut locutus est ad patres nostros, Abraham et semini ejus in saecula (<i>As he promised to our forefathers, Abraham and his seed for ever</i>)

    Magnificat anima mea Dominum (<i>My soul doth magnify the Lord</i>)
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The Magnificat is a canticle also known as the "Song of Mary", "Canticle of Mary", or "Ode of the Theotokos" (Theotokos is a Greek title for Mary roughly meaning 'Mother of God'). The text is taken from the Gospel of Luke 1:46-55; this section of the gospel is known as the Visitation. Traditionally a doxology (the Gloria Patri) is appended to the canticle, but is ommitted by Part in lieu of repeating the initial line. The Latin text is from the Vulgate, the provided English translation is from the Book of Common Prayer.

    Authorship of the Gospel of Luke is traditionally attributed to Luke the Evangelist, mentioned as a companion of Paul the Apostle, though the actual text is anonymous. The gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke all share large quantities of material, and the literary relationship between the three is unknown (the 'synoptic problem'). However the Magnificat is material unique to Luke. Seen through the lens of some of the most common synoptic theories, this could mean the material was indeed authored by the author of Luke, taken from a lost 'Q source' of material from which Matthew and Luke drew (and Mark did not), or taken from a different lost 'L source' from which only Luke drew.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    Messiah has 53 movements. A full performance of the oratorio usually takes over two hours, not counting intermission time. However it is most enduring in popular culture—and probably being referenced in this wiki because of—the 44th movement, aka the "Hallelujah Chorus", and that movement is the only one included in the provided lyrics.
    
    The words are from the King James Bible, Revelation 19:6, 11:15, and 19:16. The Book of Revelation claims to be written by 'John' on the island of Patmos. Christian tradition claims this to be John the Apostle and also John the Evangelist (author of the Gospel of John), but scholars generally consider these to be three different people and separate the author of Revelation as 'John of Patmos'.

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    While this composition is commonly known as the "Moonlight Sonata", the name comes from a critic's remark on this work a few years after Beethoven's death. This sonata, Piano Sonata No. 14, was published alongside his (much less well-known) Piano Sonata No. 13, both under the title "Sonata quasi una Fantasia" (<i>Sonatas in the style of a Fantasia</i>), categorized as his opus number 27.

    The lyrics by [[artist:talhaiarn]] were publshed in 1862, alongside the original [[track:deck-the-halls]] lyrics. (Thank you to megatti from the HSMusic Wiki for providing a translation!) However the most popular Welsh lyrics for this melody were published in 1873 by [[artist:john-ceiriog-hughes]], and are shown here as alternate lyrics. They're not only completely different but also were published alongside another completely separate set of English lyrics, 'Soon The Hoar Old Year Will Leave Us' by John Oxenford. The original melody dates back to 16th-century Wales.

Lyrics: |-
    I've just come back from a lovely trip
    Along the Milky Way
    I stopped off at the North Pole
    To spend the holiday

    I called on dear old Santa Claus
    To see what I could see
    He took me to his workshop
    And told his plan to me

    So you better watch out
    You better not cry
    You better not pout
    I'm telling you why
    Santa Claus is comin' to town

    He's making a list
    Checking it twice
    Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
    Santa Claus is comin' to town

    He sees you when you're sleeping
    He knows when you're awake
    He knows if you've been good or bad
    So be good for goodness' sake

    Oh you better watch out
    You better not cry
    You better not pout
    I'm telling you why
    Santa Claus is comin' to town

    Oh you better watch out

    This carol dates from the 13th century though its first known printing is in "Piae Cantiones ecclesiasticae et scholasticae veterum episcoporum" (<i>Pious ecclesiastical and school songs of the ancient bishops</i>) from 1582. The provided English versions of the lyrics come from "The Oxford Book of Carols" from 1928, probably the most well known translation. It is a free translation, rather than a literal one, in order to fit the lyrical structure and flow of the "Flower Carol". The added doxology at the end of the translation is not included.

Lyrics: |-
    To Anacreon, in Heav'n, where he sat in full glee
    A few sons of harmony sent a petition
    That he their inspirer and patron would be
    When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian
    Voice, fiddle and flute, no longer be mute
    I'll lend ye my name, and inspire you to boot
    And, besides, I'll instruct you, like me, to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And, besides, I'll instruct you, like me, to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    The news through Olympus immediately flew
    When Old Thunder pretended to give himself airs
    If these mortals are suffer'd their scheme to pursue
    The devil a goddess will stay above stairs
    Hark! Already they cry in transports of joy
    Away to the Sons of Anacreon we'll fly
    And there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    The yellow-hair'd god, and his nine fusty maids
    From Helicon's banks will incontinent flee
    Idalia will boast but of tenantless shades
    And the biforked hill a mere desert will be
    My Thunder, no fear on't shall soon do its errand
    And dam'me! I'll swing the ringleaders, I warrant
    I'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    I'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    Apollo rose up; and said, Pr'ythee ne'er quarrel
    Good King of the gods, with my vot'ries below!
    Your thunder is useless- then, shewing his laurel
    Cry'd, Sic evitabile fulmen, you know!
    Then over each head my laurels I'll spread
    So my sons from your crackers no mischief shall dread
    Whilst snug in their club-room, they jovially twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    Whilst snug in their club-room, they jovially twine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    Next Momus got up, with his risible phiz
    And swore with Apollo he'd cheerfully join
    The full tide of harmony still shall be his
    But the song, and the catch, and the laugh shall be mine
    Then, Jove, be not jealous of these honest fellows
    Cry'd Jove, We relent, since the truth you now tell us
    And swear by Old Styx that they long shall entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And swear by Old Styx that they long shall entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

    Ye sons of Anacreon, then, join hand in hand
    Preserve unanimity, friends and love
    'Tis your's to support what's so happily plan'd
    You've the sanction of gods, and the fiat of Jove
    While thus we agree, our toast let it be
    May our club flourish happy, united, and free!
    And long may the sons of Anacreon entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!
    And long may the sons of Anacreon entwine
    The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine!

Lyrics: |-
    The first Noel the angels did say
    Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay
    In fields where they lay keeping their sheep
    On a cold winter's night that was so deep

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    They looked up and saw a star
    Shining in the east, beyond them far
    And to the earth it gave great light
    And so it continued, both day and night

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    And by the light of that same star
    Three wise men came from country far
    To seek for a king was their intent
    And to follow the star wherever it went

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    This star drew nigh to the northwest
    O'er Bethlehem it took it's rest
    And there it did both stop and stay
    Right over the place where Jesus lay

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Then did they know assuredly
    Within that house, the king did lie
    One entered in then for to see
    And found the babe in poverty

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Then enter'd in those wise men three,
    Full reverently upon their knee,
    And offer'd there, in his presence,
    Their gold, and myrrh, and frankincense

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Between an ox stall and an ass
    This child truly there born he was
    For want of clothing they did him lay
    All in a manger, among the hay

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    Now let us all with one accord
    Sing praises to our heavenly Lord
    That hath made heaven and earth of nought
    And with his blood mankind hath bought

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

    If we in our time shall do well
    We shall be free from death and Hell
    For God hath prepared for us all
    A resting place in general

    Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
    Born is the King of Israel

Lyrics: |-
    Dashing through the snow
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    O'er the fields we go
    Laughing all the way
    Bells on bob tail ring
    Making spirits bright
    What fun it is to ride and sing
    A sleighing song tonight! Oh!

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

    A day or two ago
    I thought I'd take a ride
    And soon, Miss Fanny Bright
    Was seated by my side
    The horse was lean and lank
    Misfortune seemed his lot
    He got into a drifted bank
    And then we got upsot

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

    A day or two ago
    The story I must tell
    I went out on the snow
    And on my back I fell
    A gent was riding by
    In a one-horse open sleigh
    He laughed as there I sprawling lie
    But quickly drove away, ah!

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

    Now the ground is white
    Go it while you're young
    Take the girls tonight
    and sing this sleighing song
    Just get a bobtailed bay
    Two forty as his speed
    Hitch him to an open sleigh
    And snap! you'll take the lead

    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh! what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh, hey!
    Jingle bells, jingle bells
    Jingle all the way!
    Oh what fun it is to ride
    In a one-horse open sleigh!

Lyrics: |-
    O say can you see, by the dawn's early light
    What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming
    Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight
    O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?
    And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air
    Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there
    O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave?

    On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep
    Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes
    What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep
    As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses?
    Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam
    In full glory reflected now shines in the stream
    'Tis the star-spangled banner, O long may it wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

    And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
    That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion
    A home and a country, should leave us no more?
    Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution
    No refuge could save the hireling and slave
    From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave
    And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave

    O thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand
    Between their loved homes and the war's desolation
    Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heav'n rescued land
    Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation!
    Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just
    And this be our motto: 'In God is our trust.'
    And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave
    O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave!

    It's all in your hands, it's all in your hands
    It's all in your hands, it's all in your hands

    I don't understand it 'cause you won't say yes
    But you don't say no

Lyrics: |-
    (Greetings, my dear Chad.)
    (Sup.)
    (So Chad, our deal. What will it be. Do you want to keep this universe the way it is? Do you want to create an all new universe, or would you like to merge this universe and our old one?)
    (...I want the real SilvaGunner back. Merge them.)
    (And you understand the repercussions this entails, right?)
    (Yeah. I hate to say this, but you're right. It's for the better. No more [[track:snow-halation]]. I accept.)
    (A wise choice, my dear Chad. Remember... it's for the fans. Oh, and Chad? If you happen to be epileptic, you might want to turn away. The restoration process could get a little messy on the eyes. Unless of course, you happen to have seen this process before. But you certainly couldn't have, right? Let us begin.)

    (Hmm, let's check it out. GRAND DAD? FLEENTSTONES? [unintelligible] WHAT THE FUCK?)

    Soulja Boy off in this ho
    Watch me crank it, watch me roll
    Watch me crank that Soulja Boy, then Superman that ho
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    (Now watch me yuu) Crank that Soulja Boy
    Now watch—

    Doors swang on niggas that got bad behavior
    My four 15's woke up the neighbors
    Interior crocodile alligator
    I drive a Chevrolet movie theater

    (AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH)
    (Y'all already know what it is, Street Starz Radio, world famous Prettyboy Floyd, [[artist:king-chip|Chip tha Ripper]]!)

    So they're finally here, performing for you
    If you know the spurts, you can join in too
    Put your hands together, if you want to clap
    If you like "[[track:snow-halation|Snow halation]]" you need to shoot yourself

    HUH!
    SH! "Snow halation" sucks!
    SH! "Snow halation" isn't funny
    CG! Coconut Gun

    (As my gift to the pope, I gave him a copy of Undertale.)

    Eh, sexy lady
    Op, op, op, op, oppa Gangnam Style
    Eh, sexy lady
    Op, op, op, op—

    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees
    So hip to fuck bees

    (AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!)
    (AUUGHHHHHH)
    (HERRRG)
    (It takes four hours to beat it! Four hours long!)

    [Unintelligible]

    (Hey everyone, I'm back! I only upload high quality video game rips!)
    (Don't be sad, Chad. After all, we have created the perfect utopia for SiLvaGunner. No more snow, no more discourse. Just a grand, gay old time, and high quality rips.)
    (It's not the same.)
    (You can rule by my side, Chad. We can be the ultimate Grand Dads. We shall usher SilvaGunner into a new high quality era.)
    (...aight.)
    (Come now, Chad. We have much work to do.)

Track: A Song About a Circle Constant
Artists:
- Vi Hart
Duration: '3:48'
URLs:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtxmFlMLYRI
Lyrics: |-
    When you want to make a circle, how is it done?
    Well, you probably will start with the radius 1
    Then use a compass, or a string, and use a paper or the ground
    And if the radius is 1, how far did it go around?

    It's tau! 6.28
    Yeah, it's tau! 6.28
    3185307
    17958...

    If you pick a certain distance, and you pick a certain spot
    And you put the two together, then what have you got?
    It makes a very special shape, and now you are the inventor
    If you take all of the points a certain distance from your center

    And you've got a great collection, and it is a great invention
    And it makes a lovely circle, well depending on dimension
    Cause there's 1, 2, 3, then there's 4 and even more
    But for a circle, how much circle's there if you take the distance and compare?

    It's tau! 6.28
    Yeah, it's tau! 6.28
    3185307
    17958...
    647692528

    I know what you are thinking, what about that other guy?
    The one that's sometimes pronounced pee, and sometimes pronounced pie?
    I mean it's fine if you are building, but does not belong in math
    All the equations make more sense when you use taw, you use taff!

    And while you get the same answer no matter which way
    We get further from truth when we obscure what we say
    You know that math makes sense when it's beautiful and pure
    So please don't make it ugly with your bad notation and awful curriculum

    Use tau! 6.28
    Yeah, use tau! 6.28
    3185307
    17958

Lyrics: |-
    Hey, how you doin'? (Uh)
    Thanks for coming to my studio apartment
    Got some shit to say (That's right)

    The times we've had
    And the times we've missed
    The times we've embraced
    And the times we've kissed
    The times we've loved
    And the times we've laughed
    Now it's time
    To accept my shaft (Whoa)
    My shaft

    The times we've spent
    And the times we've shared
    The times we've shown each other
    Just how much we care
    The times we've lived
    All the times for reflection
    Now you must survive
    My thunderous erection (Whoa)
    It's enough of a shaft (A shaft)

    Don't leave, don't run
    You are the only one
    I can be myself around
    I've come undone
    You are the only one
    Who can lift my heart
    Up off the ground

    The times behind
    And the times foretold
    Forgive me if I'm being
    Just a bit too bold
    But our sweet love
    Won't be forsaken
    Once you are
    Gargling my bacon

    Oh, the times we've seen
    And the times ahead
    Grab a couple pillows
    And get on that bed
    You'll want to lay back
    And clear your calendar
    Once I introduce you to my friend
    Excalibur (Excalibur, Excalibur)

    You take me higher
    You set my loins afire
    You are the slam pig I desire
    Dear god, I'll plow
    You all around the house
    Cause you lift my heart
    Up off the ground

    Lift my heart up off the ground
    But, try find a way to incorporate the shaft
    While you're doing so
    Actually, you know what?
    Really concentrate on the shaft
    More-so than the, than the heart
    The shaft should definitely be your main focus
    Can't stress that enough

Lyrics: |-
    Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
    I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
    She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
    In the shape of an "L" on her forehead

    Well
    The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

    So much to do, so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
    You'll never know if you don't go (W-w-wacko)
    You'll never shine if you don't glow

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold

    It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
    You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
    But the meteor men beg to differ
    Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

    The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
    The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
    My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
    That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    All that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold

    Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko)
    Go for the moon (W-w-wacko, w-w-wacko)
    Go for the moon
    Go-go-go for the moon

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars...

    Somebody once asked, "Could I spare some change for gas?"
    "I need to get myself away from this place"
    I said, "Yep, what a concept"
    I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change

    Well
    The years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
    Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
    Didn't make sense not to live for fun
    Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb

    So much to do, so much to see
    So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
    You'll never know if you don't go (Go!)
    You'll never shine if you don't glow

    Hey now, you're an all star
    Get your game on, go play
    Hey now, you're a rock star
    Get the show on, get paid
    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold

    And all that glitters is gold
    Only shootin' stars break the mold...

Lyrics: |-
    I've lived in lonely cities
    I've crossed deserts on camel back
    And I've filled the halls of folklore with things I'd rather we forget
    I could sweep you off the street so, saying this is goddamn tough
    But this town might be big enough...

    See, I reckon what you're saying
    But this dog's run every course
    I've roamed without my boots on
    I've raced without my horse
    And then I ate my horse's meat straight from my horse's bones
    'Cause this dog
    Must roam alone

    You could shoot me in the mountains
    In the cold fat rain
    We could do it in the countryside
    As we walk the plain
    It wouldn't give us any closure
    All cowboys need to trust
    That this town might be big enough
    For both of us

    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

    Well, I'd be a doggamn liar
    If I said this ain't a lonely town
    And what I wouldn't give
    To have a friend around
    We could trade in all our silver bullets
    And buy a patch of dust
    This town might just be big enough
    For all of us

    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

    Everybody!
    This town!
    This world!
    Are you big enough?

    From Australia to America
    And Russia and China
    All of Asia
    Let me out

    Europe and Great Britain
    Oh Canada
    In Croatia and Serbia
    Kenya get it India
    It's serious in Syria
    Believe in us Bolivia
    We're Ghana be big enough

    For Africa, South Africa
    South Korea, North Korea
    Algeria, Nigeria
    Antarctica, around the Equator
    Cuba, Indonesia
    Jamaica, we'll take ya
    To Florida and catch you later

    I'll catch you later

    Let me out

    Driven by hate, consumed by fear

    Let the bodies hit the flooooooor!

    One! Nothing wrong with me
    Two! Nothing wrong with me
    Three! Nothing wrong with me
    Four! Nothing wrong with me
    One! Something's got to give
    Two! Something's got to give
    Three! Something's got to give
    Now!

    Let the bodies hit the floor!
    Let the bodies hit the floor!

    There are official English lyrics to this song but they change things to mention 'memes' and 'YouTube clips', so I just ran the lyrics through Google Translate instead.

Lyrics: |-
    I feel so unsure
    As I take your hand
    And lead you to the dance floor
    As the music dies
    Something in your eyes
    Calls to mind a silver screen
    And all its sad goodbyes

    I'm never gonna dance again
    Guilty feet have got no rhythm
    Though it's easy to pretend
    I know you're not a fool
    Should've known better than to cheat a friend
    And waste a chance that I've been given
    So I'm never gonna dance again
    The way I danced with you

    Time can never mend
    The careless whispers
    Of a good friend
    To the heart and mind
    Ignorance is kind
    There's no comfort in the truth
    Pain is all that you'll find

    I'm never gonna dance again
    Guilty feet have got no rhythm
    Though it's easy to pretend
    I know you're not a fool
    Should've known better than to cheat a friend (Should've known better, yeah)
    And waste a chance that I've been given
    So I'm never gonna dance again
    The way I danced with you

    Never without your love

    Tonight, the music seems so loud
    I wish that we could lose this crowd
    Maybe it's better this way
    We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say
    We could have been so good together
    We could have lived this dance forever
    But now who's gonna dance with me?
    Please stay

    And I'm never gonna dance again
    Guilty feet have got no rhythm
    Though it's easy to pretend
    I know you're not a fool
    Should've known better than to cheat a friend
    And waste a chance that I've been given
    So I'm never gonna dance again
    The way I danced with you

    Now that you're gone
    Now that you're gone
    Now that you're gone
    Was what I did so wrong, so wrong
    That you had to leave me alone?

Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    This demo was reused for many other Casio devices. Manuals and literature sometimes refer to it as "German Folk Song" (partially correct) or "Unterlanders Heimweh" (lit. "Lowlander's Homesickness") (which is a different German folk song, although later Casio devices actually used the correct song instead). Japanese materials correctly refer to it as a version of "Yama No Ongakuka".

    To have a good time, that's all I ever wanted
    I dreamt that a genie came and gave me three wishes

    I'm street dreamin', on the beach even (He not like)
    With some high aimed kicks from the last season— moment (The banana)

    I see your face before my eyes
    I'm falling into darkness
    Why must I fight to stay alive?
    Heroes fallen

    Wake me, can't you hear me calling?
    Out of darkness, they come crawling

    Here I am, I am lost in your land
    And I hope you will be creeping in my soul
    Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call
    And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul

    Creeps from the deep's gonna be freaking up your mind
    Creeps from the deep's gonna be feeding off your spine

    I fade away into the night
    My eyes are closing in
    Shadows are fleeing from the light
    My nightmares can begin

    Wake me, can't you hear me calling?
    Out of darkness, they come crawling

    Here I am, I am lost in your land
    And I hope you will be creeping in my soul
    Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call
    And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul

    Creeping in my soul, it's getting out of control
    I got to find my escape and get out of this black hole
    'Cause justice in the world is hard to find
    Time has come, got to make up my mind
    No matter how deep or remote I hide
    All my thoughts seem caught up inside
    Creeps from the deep's gonna be freaking up your mind
    Creeps from the deep's gonna be feeding off your spine

    Here I am, I am lost in your land
    And I hope you will be creeping in my soul
    Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call
    And I'll always believe, creeping in my soul

    Here I am, I am lost in your land (Here, I am)
    And I hope you will be creeping in my soul (I'm lost)
    Shadows fall, let me out, hear my call (I'm lost)

    Comin' on to the light of day, we got
    Many moons that are deep at play so I
    Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
    You and I both know, everything must go away
    Ah, what do you say?

    Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
    Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
    Sneak attack from the zodiac but I see your fire spark
    Eat the breeze and go, blow by blow and go away
    Oh, what do you say? Yeah!

    You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
    Dark necessities are part of my design and
    Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
    Dark necessities are part of my design

    Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
    No time for the afterthought, they're like
    Ice Cream for an Astronaut, well, that's me looking for we
    Turn the corner and find the world at your command
    Playin' the hand, yeah!

    Do you want it, do you want it now?
    Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
    Do you want it, do you want it now?

    Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
    Track record of a maniac so I
    Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
    Any way we roll, everything must go away
    Oh, what do you say? Yeah!

Lyrics: |-
    Baby cried the day the circus came to town
    'Cause she didn't want parades just passing by her
    So she painted on a smile and took up with some clown
    While she danced without a net upon the wire
    I know a lot about her, 'cause you see
    Baby is an awful lot like me

    Don't cry out loud
    Just keep it inside
    And learn how to hide your feelings
    Fly high and proud
    And if you should fall
    Remember you almost had it all
    Baby saw that when they pulled that big top down
    They left behind her dreams among the litter
    And the different kind of love she thought she'd found
    There was nothing left but sawdust and some glitter
    But Baby can't be broken, 'cause you see
    She had the finest teacher, that was me
    I told her

    Don't cry out loud
    Just keep it inside
    And learn how to hide your feelings
    Fly high and proud
    And if you should fall
    Remember you almost had it all

    Don't cry out loud
    Just keep it inside
    And learn how to hide your feelings
    Fly high and proud
    And if you should fall
    Remember you almost made it

    Don't cry out loud
    Just keep it inside
    And learn how to hide your feelings
    Fly high and proud
    And if you should fall
    Remember you almost had it all

    And if a nigga get a attitude
    Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot
    I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
    And I roll the best weed, 'cause I got it goin' on

    I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams (Yep)
    See these ice cubes? (Uh) See these Ice Creams?
    Eligible bachelor, million dollar boat
    That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
    The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
    The interior like suicide-wrist red
    I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
    Cheat on your man, ma, that's how you get ahizzead

    Killer with the beat, I know killers in the street
    With the steel that'll make you feel like chinchilla in the heat
    So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that
    Raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
    When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
    You should think about it, take a second
    Matter-fact, you should take four, B
    And think before you fuck with lil' Skateboard P

    See, I specialize in makin' all the girls get naked
    So bring your friends, all of y'all come inside
    We got a world premiere right here, now get live (So don't)
    So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a little
    I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles

Lyrics: |-
    I might be at a table, and suddenly I'll catch
    A fleeting vision of her crystal seas
    Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard far away
    Underneath a sun I've never seen

    'Cause I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth
    But I'll never see again the planet Earth, my Earth

    I might be chasing waves of light, out towards the rim
    Where stars are sparse and the cold of space seeps in
    Or I might be in a bar-room drinking methylated gin
    And thinking of the places I have been

    Yes I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth
    But I'll never see again the planet Earth, my Earth

    I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth
    But I'll never see again the planet Earth, my Earth

    Cast adrift amongst the stars I float from sun to sun
    Dreaming of the world that gave me birth
    All the places I have been remind me there is none
    To match the cool green rolling hills of Earth

    'Cause I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth
    But I'll never see again the planet Earth, my Earth

    You're so hypnotizing
    Could you be the devil, could you be an angel?
    Your touch, magnetizing
    Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing

    They say, be afraid
    You're not like the others, futuristic lover
    Different DNA
    They don't understand you

    You're from a whole 'nother world
    A different dimension
    You open my eyes
    And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

    Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
    Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
    Take me, ta-ta-take me
    Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

    Boy, you're an alien
    Your touch, so foreign
    It's supernatural
    Extraterrestrial

    You're so supersonic
    Wanna feel your powers, stun me with your lasers
    Your kiss is cosmic
    Every move is magic

    You're from a whole 'nother world
    A different dimension
    You open my eyes
    And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

    Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
    Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
    Take me, ta-ta-take me
    Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

    Boy, you're an alien
    Your touch, so foreign
    It's supernatural
    Extraterrestrial

    This is transcendental
    On another level
    Boy, you're my lucky star
    I wanna walk on your wavelength
    And be there when you vibrate
    For you, I'll risk it all, all

    Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
    Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
    Take me, ta-ta-take me
    Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction

    Boy, you're an alien
    Your touch, so foreign
    It's supernatural
    Extraterrestrial
    Extraterrestrial

    Boy, you're an alien

    (He-Man!)
    (Hi there, I'm Adam, Prince of Eternia! This is my kitty Mr. Cringerpants, the most cutest kitty in the universe! Fabulous secret powers reveal to me the day I held aloft my magic sword, and sang:)

    Twenty-five years and my life is still
    Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
    For a destination
    I realized quickly when I knew I should
    That the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
    For whatever that means

    And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
    Just to get it all out what's in my head and I!
    I'm feeling a little peculiar
    And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
    And I take a deep breath and I get real high, and I
    Scream from the top of my lungs
    What's going on?

    And I say, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, hey-yeah-yeah
    I said hey, what's going on?
    And I say, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, hey-yeah-yeah
    I said hey, what's going on? (Ooh!)

    (And he tries) Oh my god, do I try!
    I try all the time, in this institution
    (And he prays!) Oh my god, do I pray!
    I pray every single day! (Yeah!)
    For a revolution!

    And I say, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, hey-yeah-yeah
    I said hey, what's going on?
    And I say, HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, hey-yeah-yeah (Don't cry out loud)
    I said hey (Just keep it inside, and learn how to hide your feelings)
    (HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA, hey-yeah—) Yeah-yeah-yeah!
    I said hey, what's going on?! (Oh yeah!)

    Twenty-five years I'm alive here still
    Trying to get up that great big hill of hope
    For a destination

    You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
    You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
    A melancholy town where we never smile

    When you kiss me
    Fever when you hold me tight
    Fever in the mornin'
    Fever all through the night

    Listen to me, baby
    Hear every word I say
    No one can love you the way I do
    'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

    You give me fever
    When you kiss me
    Fever when you hold me tight
    Fever in the mornin'
    And fever all through the night

    Bless my soul, I love you
    Take this heart away
    Take these arms I'll never use
    And just believe in what my lips have to say

    You give me fever
    When you kiss me
    Fever when you hold me tight
    Fever in the mornin'
    And fever all through the night

    Sun lights up the daytime
    Moon lights up the night
    My eyes light up when you call my name
    'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

    You give me fever
    When you kiss me
    Fever when you hold me tight
    Fever (Fever, burn through) in the mornin'
    And fever all through the night

Lyrics: |-
    You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
    Lit up the world as I fell asleep
    'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
    You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

    I'd like to make myself believe
    That planet Earth turns slowly
    It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
    'Cause everything is never as it seems

    'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs from ten thousand lightning bugs
    As they tried to teach me how to dance
    A foxtrot above my head, a sock hop beneath my bed
    A disco ball is just hanging by a thread

    I'd like to make myself believe
    That planet Earth turns slowly
    It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
    'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

    Leave my door open just a crack
    (Please take me away from here)
    'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
    (Please take me away from here)
    Why do I tire of counting sheep
    (Please take me away from here)
    When I'm far too tired to fall asleep?

    To ten million fireflies, I'm weird 'cause I hate goodbyes
    I got misty eyes as they said farewell (They said farewell)
    But I'll know where several are if my dreams get real bizarre
    'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (Jar, jar, jar)

    I'd like to make myself believe
    That planet Earth turns slowly
    It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
    'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

    I'd like to make myself believe
    That planet Earth turns slowly
    It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
    'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

    I'd like to make myself believe
    That planet Earth turns slowly
    It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
    Because my dreams are bursting at the seams

    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees

    I like my bees in fuck suits
    I fuck bees on TV
    I'm fucking bees 'most everyday
    And fucking bees
    They tell me that it's good to fuck bees
    But I fuck bees

    I know that it's crazy
    I know that it's nowhere
    There is no denying that

    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees
    So hip to fuck bees

    Fuuuuuuck beeeeees

    It's not too hard to fuck bees
    You see it everyday
    And those that were the farthest out
    Have fucked bees
    You see bees on the freeway
    It don't look like a lot of fuck
    But don't you try to fuck me
    A bee who's time has come

    Don't tell me that I'm crazy
    Don't tell me I'm nowhere
    Take it from me

    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees
    It's hip to fuck bees
    So hip to fuck bees
    Tell 'em boys

    Bees, bees, they're everywhere

Lyrics: |-
    (Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect, Judge Dre presiding. In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department, prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy-motherfucking-E. Order, order, order! Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help your black ass?)
    (You goddamn right.)
    (Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?)

    Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
    A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
    And not the other color, so police think
    They have the authority to kill a minority
    Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
    For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
    To be beating on and thrown in jail
    We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell

    Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
    With a little bit of gold and a pager
    Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
    Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
    You'd rather see me in the pen
    Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
    Beat a police out of shape
    And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape

    To tape off the scene of the slaughter
    Still getting swole off bread and water
    I don't know if they [f-slur] or what
    Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
    And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
    But don't let it be a black and a white one
    'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
    Black police showing out for the white cop

    Ice Cube will swarm
    On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
    Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
    Punk police are afraid of me, huh
    A young nigga on the warpath
    And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
    Of cops dying in L.A. 
    Yo, Dre, I got something to say

    Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
    Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
    Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
    Fuck the police (Example of scene one)

    (Pull your goddamn ass over right now!)
    (Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?)
    ('Cause I feel like it! Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!)
    (Man, fuck this shit!)
    (Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!)
    (MC Ren, will you please give your testimony to the jury about this fucked up incident?)

    Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
    Because the niggas on the street is a majority
    A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
    And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
    A stash spot for the so-called law
    Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
    Lights start flashing behind me
    But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me

    But that shit don't work, I just laugh
    Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
    For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!"
    Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
    Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
    With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
    But take off the gun so you can see what's up
    And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up

    Make you think I'ma kick your ass
    But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
    I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
    But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
    Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
    Or any asshole that threatens me
    I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
    Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me

    The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
    With potential to get bad as fuck
    So I'ma turn it around
    Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound 
    Yeah, somethin' like that
    But it all depends on the size of the gat
    Takin' out a police would make my day
    But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say

    Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
    Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
    Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—
    Fuck the police

    (Yeah, man, what you need?)
    (Police, open now, we have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest!)
    (Aww, shit)
    (Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!)
    (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
    (What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?)
    (Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor!)
    (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
    (But I didn't do shit!)
    (Man, just shut the fuck up!)
    (Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand and tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?)

    I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
    Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
    Shining the light in my face, and for what?
    Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
    I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
    On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
    Of an Uzi or an AK
    'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say

    They put out my picture with silence
    'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
    The E with the criminal behavior
    Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
    Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
    A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
    By me or another nigga
    And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger

    Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool
    And as you all know, E's here to rule
    Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
    And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
    Dumb motherfucker with a gun
    And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
    That I take out, and then get away
    While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say

    Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
    Fuck the police, fuck—
    Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
    Fuck the police (The verdict)

    (The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker.)
    (Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!)
    (Get him out of here!)
    (I want justice!)
    (Get him the fuck out my face!)
    (I want justice!)
    (Out, right now!)
    (Fuck you, you black motherfuckers!)

    Fuck the police
    Fuck the police
    Fuck the police

Lyrics: |-
    (When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar, I definitely wanted to become a musician. It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town; was studying, and when I finally broke away from school and became a musician I thought, "Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance". Because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music. At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes. I think I had about seven, eight songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning. I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future. And I said, "Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?" And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog Modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future, but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.)

    (My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.)

    (Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being "correct" you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.)

Lyrics: |-
    (G'day, mate. That's how you say it? G'day, mate, hahaha.)
    (Yah.)
    Commence!

    I woke up this morning like I gotta get going
    Tomorrow's not promised so I live in the moment
    It's a good day to have a good day
    It's a good day to have a good day
    I woke up this morning like I gotta get going
    Tomorrow's not promised so I live in the moment
    It's a good day to have a good day
    It's a good day to have a good day

    Woke up this morning with my mind on my money
    Hard work payin' off, I don't owe nobody nuttin'
    On my west coast tip, so you know I'm trying to function
    And touch a private part even though we in public
    You playing hard to get, but I'm thinking easy does it
    To have a good time, that's all I ever wanted
    I dreamt that a genie came and gave me three wishes
    A Cuban link chain, fly clothes, and bad women
    I'm street dreamin', on the beach even
    With some high aimed kicks from the last season
    'Cause I know nobody got 'em that's the main reason
    So I'm dressed to impress and get the better treatment

    Slow down
    Can't lose 'cause I don't know how
    One day then I gotta skip town
    No negative energy allowed
    I'mma show you how

    I woke up this morning like I gotta get going
    Tomorrow's not promised so I live in the moment
    It's a good day to have a good day
    It's a good day to have a good day
    I woke up this morning like I gotta get going
    Tomorrow's not promised so I live in the moment
    It's a good day to have a good day
    It's a good day to have a good day

    This is that life that a guy can get used to
    Get everyone inside the club with no issues
    Surrounded by women that normally diss you
    Don't complicate life, it can all be so simple
    Thank God for the people that got put in my life
    Good times, so fun I would have did that twi-twice
    Rolex what I call spendin' quality time
    Call the air clear, lenses they coverin' my eyes
    Black, golden, oh man, got you open
    Take action and focus, now we rollin'
    With the cameras flashin' in the daylight
    Good day like Australians who make a great night

    Just lately
    I don't believe hopes or maybes
    Hard work means you can't get lazy
    The 80s made me, I'm so awesome
    (I deserve to ride foreign)

    I woke up this morning like I gotta get going
    Tomorrow's not promised so I live in the moment
    It's a good day to have a good day
    It's a good day to have a good day
    I woke up this morning like I gotta get going
    Tomorrow's not promised so I live in the moment
    It's a good day to have a good day
    It's a good day to have a good day

    Actually, it was me and Michael Jordan and the cast of Space Jam
    It was called "Me and Space Jam"

    (Another verse where you actually talk about the shit!)
    (I didn't even mention the thing! Alright, here we go.)
    
    I took "Me and Space Jam"
    And I turned it into a website

    You can visit it, visit it, visit it

Lyrics: |-
    I used to be a renegade, I used to fool around
    But I couldn't take the punishment and had to settle down
    Now I'm playing it real straight, and yes, I cut my hair
    You might think I'm crazy, but I don't even care
    Because I can tell what's going on

    It's hip to be square
    It's hip to be square

    I like my bands in business suits, I watch them on TV
    I'm working out most every day and watching what I eat
    They tell me that it's good for me, but I don't even care
    I know that it's crazy, I know that it's nowhere
    But there is no denying that

    It's hip to be square
    It's hip to be square
    It's hip to be square
    So hip to be square

    It's not too hard to figure out, you see it every day
    And those that were the farthest out have gone the other way
    You see them on the freeway, it don't look like a lot of fun
    But don't you try to fight it, an idea whose time has come
    Don't tell me that I'm crazy, don't tell me I'm nowhere
    Take it from me

    It's hip to be square
    It's hip to be square
    It's hip to be square
    So hip to be square

    Tell 'em, boys 
    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip, so hip to be square
    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip

    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip, so hip to be square
    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip

    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip, so hip to be square
    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip

    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip, so hip to be square
    Here, there, and everywhere
    Hip, hip

Lyrics: |-
    Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
    I was in your sights, you got me alone
    You found me, you found me
    You found me-e-e-e-e

    I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
    And when I fell hard, you took a step back
    Without me, without me
    Without me-e-e-e-e

    And he's long gone when he's next to me
    And I realize the blame is on me

    'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    So shame on me now
    Flew me to places I'd never been
    'Til you put me down, oh

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    So shame on me now
    Flew me to places I'd never been
    Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

    Oh, oh
    Trouble, trouble, trouble
    Oh, oh
    Trouble, trouble, trouble

    No apologies, he'll never see you cry
    Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
    You're drowning, you're drowning
    You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing

    And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
    A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
    And now, I see, now, I see
    Now, I see-e-e-e-e

    He was long gone when he met me
    And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
    So shame on me now
    Flew me to places I'd never been
    'Til you put me down, oh

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    So shame on me now
    Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
    Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

    Oh, oh
    Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
    Oh, oh
    Trouble, trouble, trouble

    And the saddest fear
    Comes creeping in
    That you never loved me
    Or her, or anyone, or anything
    Yeah

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    So shame on me now
    Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
    'Til you put me down, oh

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
    So shame on me now (Knew it right then)
    Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
    Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

    Oh, oh
    Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
    Oh, oh
    Trouble, trouble, trouble

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    Trouble, trouble, trouble
    I knew you were trouble when you walked in

    I thought love was only true in fairy tales
    Meant for someone else, but not for me
    Love was out to get me
    That's the way it seemed
    Disappointment haunted all my dreams

    Then I saw her face

    Not a trace
    Of doubt in my mind
    I'm in love
    I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried
 
    I thought love was more or less a givin' thing
    Seems the more I gave, the less I got
    What's the use in tryin'?
    All you get is pain
    When I needed sunshine, I got rain

Lyrics: |-
    (In constant sorrow through all my days)

    I am a man of constant sorrow
    I've seen trouble all my days
    I bid farewell to old Kentucky
    The state where I was borned and raised
    (The state where he was borned and raised)

    For six long years I've been in trouble
    No pleasure here on Earth I find
    For in this world I'm bound to ramble
    I have no friends to help me now
    (He has no friends to help him now)

    It's fare thee well my own true lover
    I never expect to see you again
    For I'm bound to ride that Northern railroad
    Perhaps I'll die upon this train
    (Perhaps he'll die upon this train)

    You can bury me in some deep valley
    For many years where I may lay
    Then you may learn to love another
    While I am sleeping in my grave
    (While he is sleeping in his grave)

    Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
    My face you'll never will see no more
    But there is one promise that is given
    I'll meet you on God's golden shore
    (He'll meet you on God's golden shore)
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    While the Stanley Brothers first recorded the song in 1951 (and claimed copyright on the song, as no previous performers had done so), it's the 1959 recording here linked that popularized the song and formed the basis of most modern versions.

Lyrics: |-
    I hate a moral coward, one who lacks a manly spark
    I just detest a man afraid to go home in the dark
    I always spend my evenings where there's women, wine, and song
    But like a man, I always bring my little wife along!

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew!

    The fun it doesn't stop 'til 12 on happy old Broadway
    So what's the use of going home until the break of day?
    Now something confidential, whisper not above a breath
    I once went home at 2 AM, and scared my wife to death

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew!

    I never shall forget the night I made six robbers run
    Although I didn't have a knife, a blackjack, or a gun
    I proved myself a hero of a very high degree
    I ran for home and six of them were running after me

    I'm a member of the midnight crew
    I'm a night owl and a wise bird too
    Home with the milk in the morning
    Singing the same old song
    Rise with the moon, go to bed with the sun
    Early to bed, and you'll miss all the fun
    Bring your wife and trouble, it will never trouble you
    Make her a member of the midnight crew!

Lyrics: |-
    Blinding shining star
    You won't see so far
    Know what can't be shown
    Feel what can't be known

    You were an isle unto thyself
    You had a heart you hadn't felt
    Why would it hurt me
    Or was it real

    It was the night we had to part
    We were afraid to miss the start
    What did it matter
    Why would it matter
    And could we heal

    Blinding shining star
    You won't see so far
    Know what can't be shown
    Feel what can't be known

    I was a victim of magic
    Apollo catching my breath as I bled on the ground
    Somebody called me to follow
    I followed thinking aloud without hearing the sound

    Then all the planets fell to dust
    Lonely departing after us
    Gone not forgotten
    Long but forgotten old lore

    In every element of life
    Love camouflaging under strife or other matters
    Minds over matters let there be more

    Maybe you'll exit tomorrow
    The sorrow sweeping you off as your island replies
    Sudden invincible flowing
    A river clearer than all thou might view with thine eyes

    Why did fire-erupted lands arrive
    Why did murderous animals survive
    Why did we deserve to be revived
    Why was any and everything alive

Lyrics: |-
    I don't understand it 'cause you won't say yes
    But you don't say no
    You say you know we shouldn't, you keep holding out
    But you don't let go

    I'm giving up on trying
    To sell you things that you ain't buying

    It's your move
    I've made up my mind
    Time is running out
    Make a move
    Oh, we can go on
    Do you understand, it's all in your hands
    It's your move

    You're giving me the business with that old come-on
    But you don't come across
    You get me so excited, don't you know you're such a tease?
    When I think you're getting hot, you're not

    So what's the problem? What's wrong?
    This kiss and miss, you know it can't go on

    It's your move
    I've made up my mind
    Time is running out
    Make a move
    'Cause we can't go on, I want you to know
    It's your move, your turn to go

    I'm giving up on trying
    To sell you things that you ain't buying

    It's your move
    I've made up my mind
    Time is running out
    Make a move
    Oh, we can't go on
    Do you understand, it's all in your hands

    It's your move
    I've made up my mind
    Time is running out
    Make a move
    Oh, we can't go on
    Do you understand, it's all in your hands

    It's your move (It's your move)
    I've made up my mind
    Time is running out
    Make a move
    Oh, we can't go on
    Do you understand, it's all in your hands

    It's your move
    I've made up my mind
    Time is running out...

    It don't mean a thing, if it ain't got that swing

    It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot

Lyrics: |-
    (I tell you this because as an artist I think you'll understand.)

    I'll be quiet to keep you quiet
    Don't concern yourself with my slow dying
    Through the vents I hear you sigh
    I don't get too high these days
    Your floor is my ceiling
    Lights out, you can't come in

    If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
    If you don't ask, I won't upset you

    I am jet black
    I am stone cold
    Jet black to the center
    Funny like a funeral
    I need you to bury me

    White noise in black room dust
    These hands long for one last touch
    Hourglass all out of trust
    I don't scratch so I won't itch
    I don't reach so I won't miss
    I taste our last kiss

    If you don't remind me, I won't forget you
    If you don't ask, I won't upset you

    I am jet black
    I am stone cold
    Jet black to the center
    Funny like a funeral
    I need you to bury me

    This is the cure, the same as the symptom
    Simple and pure, break to keep fixing
    Patiently nurse, patient and nurse

    This is the part I wouldn't show you
    The part where you say, I don't even know you
    This is your cue
    Be glad that it's through

    I am jet black
    I am stone cold
    Jet black to the center
    Funny like a funeral
    I need you to bury me

    (Sometimes when I'm driving on the road at night, I see two headlights coming toward me, fast. I have this sudden impulse to turn the wheel quickly head-on into the oncoming car. I can anticipate the explosion: the sound of shattering glass, the flames rising out of the flowing gasoline.)

    The breeze is a-blowin'
    The grass just won't stop growin'
    So I'd better do somethin' soon
    Gonna spend the afternoon

    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn

    This grass is taller than me
    I'm gonna make potpourri
    Out of what's left when I'm through
    Doin' what I gotta do

    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn

    Lawnmower! Rev it up good now
    Lawnmower! Listen to the sound, hey
    Lawnmower! Rev it up, take it on
    Down, take it all around town    
    Let me hear y'all

    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn

    The whole neighbourhood is unified
    'Bout time the music died
    And was replaced by the sound of one thousand motors
    Replaced by the soul-affirming grass odours

    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn
    Mowin' the lawn, mowin' the lawn

Lyrics: |-
    Look
    If you had one shot or one opportunity
    To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
    Would you capture it, or just let it slip? Yo

    His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
    There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
    He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
    To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
    What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
    He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
    He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
    The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
    Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
    There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
    Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
    His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
    He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
    When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
    Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
    Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better

    His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
    This world is mine for the taking, make me king
    As we move toward a New World Order
    A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
    Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
    Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
    These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
    He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
    God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
    He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
    But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
    These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
    They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
    He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
    Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
    But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah, dah-dah

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better

    No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
    Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
    I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
    I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
    But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
    Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
    All the pain inside amplified by the
    Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
    Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
    'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
    And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
    And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
    Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
    Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
    Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
    Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
    Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
    To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
    Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
    Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
    To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
    So here I go, it's my shot, feet, fail me not
    This may be the only opportunity that I got

    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better lose yourself in the music
    The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
    You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
    This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
    You better...

    You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Lyrics: |-
    I'm mad about the boy
    And I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
    I'm so ashamed of it
    But must admit the sleepless nights I've had
    About the boy

    On the silverscreen
    He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
    Although I'm quite aware
    That here and there are traces of the cad
    About the boy

    Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
    I really shouldn't care
    Lord knows I'm not a school girl
    Who's in the flurry of her first affair

    Will it ever cloy
    This odd diversity of misery and joy
    I'm feeling quite insane and young again
    And all because I'm mad about the boy

    I'm feeling quite insane and young again
    And all because I'm mad about the boy
Commentary: |-
    <i>Niklink:</i>
    The song originates with Coward's 1932 revue "Words and Music"; no recording exists, however. Dinah Washington's 1961 version (her second time recording it) is the most popular and enduring version.

    End of passion play, crumbling away
    I'm your source of self-destruction
    Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
    Leading on your death's construction
    Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
    Dedicated to, how I'm killing you

    Come crawling faster (Faster)
    Obey your master (Master)
    Your life burns faster (Faster)
    Obey your master, master

    Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
    Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
    Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
    Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master, master
    Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
    Master, master

    Needlework the way, never you betray
    Life of death becoming clearer
    Pain monopoly, ritual misery
    Chop your breakfast on a mirror
    Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
    Dedicated to, how I'm killing you

    Come crawling faster (Faster)
    Obey your master (Master)
    Your life burns faster (Faster)
    Obey your master, master

    Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

    Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

    Master, master
    Where's the dreams that I've been after?
    Master, master
    You promised only lies
    Laughter, laughter
    All I hear or see is laughter
    Laughter, laughter
    Laughing at my cries
    Fix me

    Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
    Just a rhyme without a reason
    Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
    Now your life is out of season
    I will occupy, I will help you die
    I will run through you, now I rule you too

    Come crawling faster (Faster)
    Obey your master (Master)
    Your life burns faster (Faster)
    Obey your master, master

    Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
    Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
    Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
    Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream

    The Michael Rosen Rap!

    You may think I'm happy
    You may think I'm sad
    You may think I'm crazy
    You may think I'm mad
    But hang on to your seats
    And listen right here
    I'm gonna tell you something
    That'll burn your ear

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap

    I was born on the 7th of May
    I remember very well that awful day
    I was in my mother, curled up tight
    Though I have to say, it was as dark as night
    Nothing to do, didn't wanna breathe
    I was so happy, didn't want to leave
    Then I hear some people give a shout
    "One push, Mrs. Rosen, and he'll be out!"
    I'm telling you, that was a puzzle to me
    I shouted out, "How'd you know I'm a he?"
    Doctor shouted, "Good lord, he can talk!"
    I popped out my head, said, "Now watch me walk!"
    I juked and jived around that room
    Balam-bam-boola balam-ba-diddy-boom

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap

    When I was one, I swam the English Channel
    When I was two, I ate a soapy flannel
    When I was three, I started getting thinner
    When I was four, I ate the dog's dinner
    When I was five, I was in a band playing drums
    When I was six, I ate a bag of plums
    When I was seven, I robbed a bank with my sister
    When I was eight, I became prime minister
    When I was nine, I closed all the schools
    When I was ten, they made me king of the fools

    So that's what I am, that's what I be
    With an M, with an I, with a K, with an E
    That's what I am, that's what I be
    Mr. Mike, Mr. Michael, Mr. Rosen, Mr. Me

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap...

    (We got a theory. You see, Mike, we got a theory about magic, and miracles.)
    (That's right, that's right.)

    If magic is all we've ever known
    Then it's easy to miss what really goes on
    But I've seen miracles in every way
    And I see miracles every day

    Oceans spanning beyond my sight
    And a million stars way above 'em at night
    We don't have to be high to look in the sky
    And know that's a miracle opened wide

    Look at the mountains, trees, the seven seas
    And everything chilling underwater, please!
    Hot lava, snow, rain and fog
    Long neck giraffes, pet cats and dogs

    And I've seen eighty-five thousand people
    All in one room, together as equal
    Pure magic is the birth of my kids
    I've seen shit that'll shock your eyelids

    The sun and the moon, and even Mars
    The Milky Way and fucking shooting stars
    UFOs, a river flows
    Plant a little seed and nature grows

    Niagara Falls and the pyramids
    Everything you believed in as kids
    Fucking rainbows, after it rains
    There's enough miracles here to blow your brains

    I fed a fish to a pelican at Frisco Bay
    It tried to eat my cell phone, he ran away
    And music is magic, pure and clean
    You can feel it and hear it but it can't be seen

    (Are you a believer in miracles?)
    Music is all magic, you can't even hold it
    (Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
    It's just there in the air
    (Are you a believer in miracles?)
    Pure motherfuckin' magic, right?
    (Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
    This shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind

    Music is a lot like love, it's all a feeling
    And it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling
    I see miracles all around me
    Stop and look around, it's all astounding

    Water, fire, air and dirt
    Fucking magnets, how do they work?
    And I don't wanna talk to a scientist
    Y'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed

    Solar eclipse, and vicious weather
    Fifteen thousand Juggalos together
    And I love my mom, for giving me this time
    On this planet, taking nothing for granted

    I seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly
    Miracles ain't nothing to lie
    Shaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy
    And my little boy looks just like daddy

    Miracles each and everywhere you look
    And nobody has to stay where they put
    This world is yours, for you to explore
    It's nothing but miracles beyond your door

    The Dark Carnival is your invitation
    To witness that without explanation
    Take a look at this fine creation
    And enjoy it better with appreciation

    Crows, ghosts, the midnight coast
    The wonders of the world, mysteries the most
    Just open your mind, and it ain't no way
    To ignore the miracles of every day, and that's real

    (Are you a believer in miracles?)
    Magic everywhere in this bitch
    (Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
    It's all around you, you don't even know it
    (Are you a believer in miracles?)
    Shit's crazy
    (Do you notice and recognize miracles?)
    (So many miracles, the magic miracles)
    Miracles!

    Are you a believer in miracles?
    Do you have time for the miracles?
    Do you notice and recognize miracles?
    So many miracles, the magic miracles

    Are you a believer in miracles?
    Do you have time for the miracles?
    Do you notice and recognize miracles? (In a world full of magic!)
    So many miracles, the magic miracles

    Are you a believer in miracles?
    Do you have time for the miracles?
    Do you notice and recognize miracles? (Miracles!)
    So many miracles, the magic miracles (Miracles!)

    Miracles!
    And don't sleep on it!
    Never!

Lyrics: |-
    Ooh, my little pretty one, pretty one
    When you gonna give me some time, Sharona?
    Ooh, you make my motor run, my motor run
    Gun it coming off of the line, Sharona

    Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
    I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
    My, my, my, I, yeah, woo!
    M-m-m-my Sharona

    Come a little closer, huh, ah will ya, huh?
    Close enough to look in my eyes, Sharona
    Keeping it a mystery gets to me
    Running down the length of my thighs, Sharona

    Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
    I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
    My, my, my, I, yeah, woo!
    M-m-m-my Sharona, m-m-m-my Sharona

    When you gonna give to me, g-give to me?
    Is it just a matter of time, Sharona?
    Is it j-just destiny, d-destiny
    Or is it just a game in my mind, Sharona?

    Never gonna stop, give it up, such a dirty mind
    I always get it up for the touch of the younger kind
    My, my, my, I, yeah, woo!

Lyrics: |-
    We're no strangers to love
    You know the rules and so do I
    A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
    You wouldn't get this from any other guy

    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
    Gotta make you understand

    Never gonna give you up
    Never gonna let you down
    Never gonna run around and desert you
    Never gonna make you cry
    Never gonna say goodbye
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

    We've known each other for so long
    Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
    Inside, we both know what's been going on
    We know the game, and we're gonna play it

    And if you ask me how I'm feeling
    Don't tell me you're too blind to see

    Never gonna give you up
    Never gonna let you down
    Never gonna run around and desert you
    Never gonna make you cry
    Never gonna say goodbye
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

    Never gonna give you up
    Never gonna let you down
    Never gonna run around and desert you
    Never gonna make you cry
    Never gonna say goodbye
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

    Ooh (Give you up)
    Ooh (Give you up)
    Ooh (Never gonna give, never gonna give) (Give you up)
    Ooh (Never gonna give, never gonna give) (Give you up)

    We've known each other for so long
    Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it
    Inside, we both know what's been going on
    We know the game, and we're gonna play it

    I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

    Never gonna run around and desert you
    Never gonna make you cry
    Never gonna say goodbye

    Never gonna give you up
    Never gonna let you down

    Never gonna make you cry
    Never gonna say goodbye
    Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

Lyrics: |-
    Floating is a feeling, that can never be described
    Goodbye April morning, goodbye lady, goodbye
    I am just a gypsy, and my home is in the sky
    Atoms are my horses, and floating is my life

    Goodbye to the morning, and goodbye to the day
    Farewell to the sunshine, because I'm leaving anyway

    There is thunder bursting in the dawn
    From the throat of a shining silver thorn

    As I jump into the sky!
    Screaming out my last goodbye!

    Floating is a feeling, that can never...


    I might be at a table, and suddenly I'll catch
    A fleeting vision of her crystal seas
    Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard far away
    Underneath a sun I've never seen

    For I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth
    Will I ever see again the planet Earth? Oh, my Earth

    I might be chasing waves of light, out towards the rim
    Where stars are sparse and the cold of space seeps in
    Or I might be in a bar-room drinking methylated gin
    And thinking of the places I have been

    For I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth
    Will I ever, see again, the planet Earth? Oh, my Earth

    Cast adrift amongst the stars I float from sun to sun
    Dreaming of the world that gave me birth
    All the places I have seen remind me there is none
    To match the cool green rolling hills of Earth


    May I remember, when I have travelled on
    The Earth's a cinder, swallowed by the sun
    There is no meaning, nor can there be
    Just an ember, burning in the night, on a velvet sea

    I didn't guess the implications when I saw the light
    Then I saw the desolation, burning, burning bright

    May I remember, by what I still have left
    A bag of Earth dust, hanging at my chest
    There is no memory that I would sell
    That is worth the half of all that's left
    Of Earth's blackened shell...

Lyrics: |-
    I see a red door and I want it painted black
    No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
    I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

    I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
    With flowers and my love, both never to come back
    I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
    Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

    I look inside myself and see my heart is black
    I see my red door, I must have it painted black
    Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
    It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

    No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
    I could not foresee this thing happening to you
    If I look hard enough into the setting sun
    My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

    I see a red door and I want it painted black
    No colours anymore, I want them to turn black
    I see the girls walk by dressed in their summer clothes
    I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

    I wanna see your face, painted black
    Black as night, black as coal
    I wanna see the sun blotted out from the sky
    I wanna see it painted, painted, painted, painted black, yxeah

Lyrics: |-
    (You wake up in the morning feeling gloriously alive, with the firm conviction that the problems that disturbed you in the past will now disappear, disappear, disappear into the midnight of your consciousness.)

    I went down to the basement
    To check up on the sour mash
    I looked down to the nonreactive ceramic tub
    It was bubbling

    I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down
    I saw the dust devils swarming around
    Incoming sun beams cut them apart
    And I watched a shadow pass across my heart

    You were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink
    Trying to cool down
    Trying to cool down

    I know you don't believe me, but I could hear you breathing
    I looked into the tub and there the mixture was seething
    With new life, new life all around
    I had stirred up the dust on the stairs coming down

    You were upstairs in the kitchen with your head against the sink
    Trying to cool down
    Trying to cool down
    Yeah

    I spent the day your way
    Call it morning driving through the sound of
    In and out the valley

    The music dance and sing
    They make the children really ring
    I spent the day your way
    Call it morning driving through the sound of
    In and out the valley

    In and around the lake
    Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
    One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
    Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
    Twenty four before my love you'll see
    I'll be there with you

    I will remember you
    Your silhouette will charge the view
    Of distant atmosphere
    Call it morning driving through the sound of
    Even in the valley

    In and around the lake

    One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
    Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too

    Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land
    Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land
    The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

    Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
    We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
    Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by a million years

Lyrics: |-
    In a different time, across the distant sea
    You'll find the older, modern stone age family
    Cars that can't be driven, lest you use your two legs
    Dinosaurs still roam this sacred world

    How do I know, how much this loincloth will show
    What's that sound in front of me, shrieking raptor melody
    It can't stop, no it won't stop, here in Bedrock

    Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
    They're the modern stone age family
    From the town of Bedrock
    They're a page right out of history

    Let's ride with the family down the street
    Through the courtesy of Fred's two feet

    When you're with the Flintstones
    Have a yabba dabba doo time
    A dabba doo time

    Doo-yabba-dabba-doo
    Yabba-dabba-dabba da-dabba-doo
    Yabba-dabba-dabba-dabba-doo
    We'll have a gay old time

    Who needs modern tech, what have you got to lose
    Live in the stone age, you will never get the blues
    Join the Loyal Order of Water Buffalo
    Just be sure you pay your daily dues

    They're all cavemen, still living way back and when
    Bowling is the sport they like, unlikely they'll get a strike
    Ride on pterodactyls, they will all, fly high

    Flintstones, meet the Flintstones
    They're the modern stone age family
    From the town of Bedrock
    They're a page right out of history

    Someday, maybe Fred will win the fight
    Then that cat will stay out for the night

    When you're with the Flintstones
    Have a yabba dabba doo time
    A dabba doo time

    Doo-yabba-dabba-doo
    Yabba-dabba-dabba da-dabba-doo
    Yabba-dabba-dabba-dabba-doo
    We'll have a gay old time

    My heart cries out, what do I call the pain
    Feelings abound, now I know the name: "Stone halation"
    How I can't wait, these feelings resonate
    It pains me so, how the time moves forward, never backward
    This fever over me, won't be gone, won't just let me be free
    I wish I was ancient history, I'll have a grand dad time

    Solresol
    All of the things that I’m trying to say could be sung in tones
    Sailing along on a lyrical boat
    Let the meaning escape your throat
    It’s a revelation of massive scope called Solresol

    Sudre the man, violin in hand, master planner
    Said “No need for words, we can sing like birds with grammar”

    Solresol
    Eliminate all the pointless chitchat with musical notes
    And once again we go back to the Seine, we go back to the source
    Good son of France invented a dance in Morse code

    I’m drowning in waves
    Don’t tear me away

    (Suicide Hotline, may I help you?)
    (Yeah... uh... well I'm 'bout to fuckin' kill myself.)
    (Listen, you don't wanna do that, okay? You don't wanna do that.)
    (I'm gonna, eh, there's so many fuckin' reasons why I don't even need to be here anymore!)
    (There's no reason-)
    (I'm gonna put a slug in my fuckin' head!)
    (You don't wanna do that, you wanna be here on Earth, okay?)
    (Fuck that shit man! I got a gun right now!)
    (Put it away!)
    (And I got it right under my chin, man, fuck that!)
    (Take it away from your chin)
    (I'm gonna fuckin' blow my head all over the ceiling!)
    (No you're not, okay-)
    (Fuck this shit, man!)
    (Hey, just talk to me, okay?)

    It ain't no point to me wakin' up
    Everybody's time I'm takin' up (No)
    I got nobody, it ain't a shoulder near
    I can't stay here and it's colder there (Where?)
    I don't wanna look back cause it's gonna hurt
    I slice my wrists and it's gonna squirt (Ooh)
    For me, everybody holds a hate
    I get backstabbed and everybody holds the stake

    It's no roads to take, I'm in a circle drive
    Bustin' at myself and I'm tryin' to survive (Ooh)
    I'll disappoint you, and I will let you down
    And I ain't got many home boys comin' around (No?)
    You don't understand, so don't say you do (Oh yes I do)
    I swear I'll put a motherfuckin' slug in you (Now, now)
    I'm the only one, the lonely one
    At home alone, loadin' a gun thinkin' why not?

    (Why not? I'll tell you why not, okay? Okay, you have feelings inside your head, okay? I understand that, feelings lead to depression. When you have depression, you have a lonely void inside of your heart, okay? And your heart means everything to the world, okay?)

    I got court comin' up, I stole'd a truck
    I got a bitch pregnant and I'm broke as fuck
    I wanna get high but I got piss test (Well)
    I'm always first name on top of the shit list (No)
    Get this, the Witch has made my chest
    It's permanent nightly visiting nest (What?)
    It ain't no clothes that I look good in
    I'm the motherfuckin' big red train that couldn't

    I got no family, I stole they shit (Okay)
    Restraining orders and I still won't quit
    I hit rock bottom, and then I fell in a hole
    And then I fell through the floor of that hole some more
    I been missing for a year, nobody's lookin' (I am)
    I got beat down and my shit tooken (Ooh)
    I look ahead and all I see is more of the same
    Or this self-inflicted bullet hole pourin' my brain

    (Okay, I understand that you're in pain, okay? I understand everything you're going through. I've been there myself, okay? Now, your pain is my pain, alright? And I feel your pain, and I wanna be your friend. Just me and you, friends.)

    I dream about cuttin' heads off with a shovel (What?)
    The dreams are gettin' serious, think I'm in trouble (Oh my)
    I don't hold memory for more than an hour
    I'm tired as fuck and I'm drained of power
    I ain't half way there and I'm all outta time
    I'm like a crushed light bulb, all outta shine (Oh no)
    I been around the world but no place is home
    I wanna see the other side when I face this chrome

    I'm butt naked, I been jackin' off gettin' drunk
    It's my last hours alive, who gives a fuck? (Me)
    It don't matter, I'm doin' this shit in the garage
    Tryin' to make it easier for them to clean my head splaage
    This bitch I loved, I hope she finds me
    Still up in the chair with my thoughts behind me (Wait, wait)
    I'm 'bout to do it (No!)
    Can you hold for a second? (Wait a min-)

    (Hello?)
    (Hey, whassup?)
    (Where you at?)
    (Right down the street.)
    (With who?)
    (My girl Shannon, we were wonderin' if we could stop by.)
    (Well shit, yeah, come on by.)
    (Really?
    (Yeah... ey ey ey, ey!)
    (I know, bring some blunts, alright.)
    (Alright, bye.)

Lyrics: |-
    You don't even bother anymore
    You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
    To hear my swan song

    I'll admit I'm impressed by your vanishing act
    Place your bets on your best guess of when you're coming back
    Draw the curtains, take the stage
    Smoke and mirrors underway
    Hold your breath, here comes the turn
    This is where we all got burned

    Promises are broken, tell me, are you happy now?
    Drowning in the hourglass, I guess our time ran out

    You don't even bother anymore
    You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
    To hear my swan song
    You don't even bother anymore
    You left me alone, I'm on my own
    Tell me where we went wrong

    Should I turn on the floodlights to shine in your eyes
    Just to get you to speak and explain why you let it die
    This new chapter in your life, read it over once or twice
    Burn the pages not the bridge
    Sew your wounds without a stitch

    Promises are broken, tell me, are you happy now?
    Drowning in the hourglass, I guess our time ran out
    I hope you're listening

    You don't even bother anymore
    You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
    To hear my swan song
    You don't even bother anymore
    You left me alone, I'm on my own
    Tell me where we went wrong
    You might also like

    Tell me where we all went wrong
    Tell me where, tell me where
    Tell me where

    Oh, abandon the people who shaped who you are
    Selfish and thoughtless, you drown in the dark
    I hope that you realize the damage you've done
    You could not see light even staring at the sun, sun

    Promises are broken, tell me, are you happy now?
    Drowning in the hourglass, I guess our time ran out

    You don't even bother anymore
    You cut to the bone, pick up the phone
    To hear my swan song
    You don't even bother anymore
    You left me alone, I'm on my own
    Tell me where we went wrong
    Tell me where we went wrong
    Tell me where we went wrong
    You don't even bother anymore

    Welcome to the Dark Carnival
    Violent J
    Shaggy 2 Dope
    The Insane Clown Posse
    Will live forever (Live forever)

    Join us (Live forever)
    Follow me (Live forever)
    Carnival awaits us (Live forever)
    Take my hand (Live forever)
    Take my hand (Live forever)
    Shangri-La (Live forever)
    Live forever (Live forever)

    Here go another clown song, freaky and weird
    I'm still preaching, I'm like Noah without the beard
    I'm trying to spread the facts that I know for sure
    Yet many don't believe in our carnival freakshow
    It's alright though, there's enough who do
    And only time will tell if our stories are true
    But for everybody here I can promise you this
    You'll never hear us rap about the typical bullshit

    Pimpin', all the money they got
    All the ice they wear, and all the people they shot
    All the freaks they pull, and all the cars they drive
    Only we rap about fucking a beehive
    You wanna keep it real? Walk out your door
    That's as real as it gets from the sky to the floor
    But the Dark Carnival will take your soul away
    And give you mythical adventure in a magical way

    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Please take me away (Take me away)
    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Come and take me away (Take me away)

    Funhouse, freak shows and murder-go-rounds
    Fuck how you looking, paint it up like a clown
    Loosen up, let it go, you ain't gotta be tense
    Faygo flying everywhere, fuck making sense
    And that's the beauty of it, look backstage
    Ain't another group out here on the same page
    Run with everybody or walk with our crew
    And stand on the moon, face the world and say "fuck you!"

    I ain't sitting out playing that star biz
    Put me in the crowd where my Juggalos is
    Treat me special I'ma leave your lip draggin
    We in this together waiting on the same wagon
    Let them laugh now, let them laugh for years
    We'll see who's laughing in the house of mirrors
    Cause that's where I'm going and if you're not
    Bump that other shit and hear about the ends they got

    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Come and take me away (Take me away)
    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Please take me away (Take me away)

    Live forever
    Take my hand
    Live forever
    Live forever

    Come take a journey through heaven and hell
    See what we have to come, and share the story I tell
    Walk hand-in-hand with the devil and God
    Let them pull you in half, purgatory is aight
    Fuck newspapers, fuck magazines
    Fuck A&Rs, and their ball-hugging jeans
    Fuck anybody trying to change our ways
    As long as 6 Joker Cards got something to say

    I speak for the crazy, I speak for scrubs
    I speak for the thugs pissing in your hot tubs
    I speak for the people that you always say don't know how to act
    We like them just like that
    Fuck your Grammys, fuck your music awards
    I strangle your host with his microphone cord
    Fuck anybody that ain't down with the clown
    From now until millenniums after I'm dead in the ground

    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Come take me away (Take me away)
    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Please take me away (Take me away)

    I live for (The Carnival)
    I die for (The Carnival)
    I pray for (The Carnival)
    Come take me away (Take me away)

Lyrics: |-
    They're gonna clean up your looks with all the lies in the books
    To make a citizen out of you
    Because they sleep with a gun and keep an eye on you, son
    So they can watch all the things you do

    Because the drugs never work, they're gonna give you a smirk
    'Cause they got methods of keeping you clean
    They're gonna rip up your heads, your aspirations to shreds
    Another cog in the murder machine

    They said all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
    They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
    So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
    Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

    The boys and girls in the clique, the awful names that they stick
    You're never gonna fit in much, kid
    But if you're troubled and hurt, what you got under your shirt
    Will make them pay for the things that they did

    They said, all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
    They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
    So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
    Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me, oh, yeah

    They said, all teenagers scare the living shit out of me
    They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
    So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
    Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me
    All together now

    Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
    They could care less as long as someone'll bleed
    So darken your clothes or strike a violent pose
    Maybe they'll leave you alone, but not me

    Teenagers scare the living shit out of me
    They could care less as long as someone'll bleed

    Woe to you, o'er Earth and Sea
    For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
    Because he knows the time is short
    Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
    For it is a human number
    Its number is six hundred and sixty-six

    I left alone, my mind was blank
    I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
    What did I see? Can I believe
    That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
    Just what I saw, in my old dreams
    Were they reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
    Cos in my dreams, it's always there
    The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
    YEAH!

    Night was black, was no use holding back
    Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
    In the mist, dark figures move and twist
    Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?

    Six-six-six, the number of the beast
    Hell and fire was spawned to be released

    Torches blazed and sacred chants were phrased
    As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
    In the night, the fires are burning bright
    The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

    Six-six-six, the number of the beast
    Sacrifice is going on tonight

    This can't go on, I must inform the law
    Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
    But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
    Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes

    Six-six-six, the number of the beast
    Six-six-six, the one for you and me

    I'm coming back, I will return
    And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
    I have the fire, I have the force
    I have the power to make my evil take its course

    A ruthless piece of art
    And it grows and speaks of mysteries to be
    And flips itself to show the deuce of hearts

    Hiyo!
    Go!

    The riddle wants, the riddle wants
    The riddle wants to be
    The riddle wants, the riddle wants
    The riddle wants to be
    To be

    It rubs our noses in nature's demands
    And it wrestles our dearest doubts out of our hands

    There is a balance of hope and despair
    How we bleed for it! In our need for it all sense disappears

    The riddle wants, the riddle wants
    The riddle wants to be
    The riddle wants, the riddle wants
    The riddle wants to be
    To be

Lyrics: |-
    Old Godzilla was hopping around
    Tokyo city like a big playground
    When suddenly Batman burst from the shade
    And hit Godzilla with a Bat-Grenade
    Godzilla got pissed and began to attack
    But didn't expect to be blocked by Shaq
    Who proceeded to open up a can of Shaq-Fu
    When Aaron Carter came out of the blue
    And he started beating up Shaquille O'Neal
    Then they both got flattened by the Batmobile
    But before it could make it back to the Batcave
    Abraham Lincoln popped out of his grave
    And took an AK-47 out from under his hat
    And blew Batman away with a rat-a-tat-tat
    But he ran out of bullets and he ran away
    Because Optimus Prime came to save the day

    This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
    Good guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see
    And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
    This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny

    Godzilla took a bite out of Optimus Prime
    Like Scruff McGruff took a bite out of crime
    And then Shaq came back covered in a tire track
    But Jackie Chan jumped out and landed on his back
    And Batman was injured and trying to get steady
    When Abraham Lincoln came back with a machete
    But suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped
    Indiana Jones took him out with his whip
    Then he saw Godzilla sneaking up from behind
    And he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find
    'Cause Batman stole it and he shot and he missed
    And Jackie Chan deflected it with his fist
    Then he jumped in the air and he did a somersault
    While Abraham Lincoln tried to pole vault
    Onto Optimus Prime but they collided in the air
    Then they both got hit by a Care Bear stare

    This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
    Good guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see
    And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
    This is the ultimate showdown

    Angels sang out an immaculate chorus
    Down from the heavens descended Chuck Norris
    Who delivered a kick which could shatter bones
    Into the crotch of Indiana Jones
    Who fell over on the ground, writhing in pain
    As Batman changed back into Bruce Wayne
    But Chuck saw through his clever disguise
    And he crushed Batman's head in between his thighs

    Then Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White
    And Monty Python and the Holy Grail's Black Knight
    And Benito Mussolini, and the Blue Meanie
    And Cowboy Curtis, and Jambi the genie
    Robocop, The Terminator, Captain Kirk, and Darth Vader
    Lo-Pan, Superman, every single Power Ranger
    Bill S. Preston and Theodore Logan
    Spock, The Rock, Doc Ock, and Hulk Hogan

    All came out of nowhere lightning fast
    And they kicked Chuck Norris in his cowboy ass
    It was the bloodiest battle that the world ever saw
    With civilians looking on in total awe
    The fight raged on for a century
    Many lives were claimed but eventually
    The champion stood, the rest saw their better
    Mr. Rogers in a blood-stained sweater

    This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny
    Good guys, bad guys and explosions, as far as the eye can see
    And only one will survive, I wonder who it will be
    This is the ultimate showdown (This is the ultimate showdown)
    This is the ultimate showdown (This is the ultimate showdown)
    This is the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny

    [Reversed]
    (The Witch)
    (Severed head)
    (Bloody smile)

    The Witch jumped on my back last night
    I couldn't breathe in its clutch, I was frozen with fright
    It went on for what seemed like hours of terror
    To see the Witch's face stare in the dark at the mirror
    The Witch told me my girlfriend was a demon
    And all this fallin' in love shit, I'm dreamin'
    And it's pain to the angels if I don't deliver
    I sealed her off in a barrel and rolled her in the river
    The Witch told me my left arm is possessed
    So I broke it at first and then I went and confessed
    But they put me in a home, the arm still wouldn't leave me alone
    Finally had to chew it off at the bone (<i>Severed head</i>)
    The Witch told me to crawl under my house and just wait
    Don't panic if I suffocate
    I bit the tail off a possum down there at one point
    It's so boring and it's dark but the Witch is my life

    Something is standing in between me and my sanity
    They say my Witch is just a dream, morbid fantasy
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)

    The Witch taught me how to cut up a body (<i>Severed head</i>)
    It's nasty and wretched and helluva bloody
    But it's gotta get done and somebody's gotta do it (<i>Bloody smile</i>)
    I kicked the fuckin' face in and put my knife through it
    The Witch jumped on me again, here we go
    Layin' in my bed, I can't breathe anymo'
    Layin' in my bed, I can't move anymo'
    There's a demon floating in my face, clampin' my jaw
    The Witch told me I gotta murder this one kid
    'Kay well maybe the witch didn't then, but I did
    With a ninja suit, crept through like a black widow
    With a crossbow, stuck him in the neck like ditto
    The Witch told me about blood that rains
    Out of the neck and what particular veins
    And about murder, witnessin' death settin' in
    And it ain't no Heaven that's lettin' me in (<i>Bloody smile</i>)

    Something is standing in between me and my sanity
    They say my Witch is just a dream, morbid fantasy
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)

    The Witch told me to put my feet in the fire and hold on
    Until everything below the knees gone
    Now I'm in a wheelchair with only an arm but don't care
    I can still throw my hatchet in the air
    The Witch got me in a predicament, it ain't good
    I got somebody head posted on my hood
    4:30 a.m. and we rollin' through the ghetto (<i>Severed head</i>)
    Shaggy ridin' shotgun and the Witch is in the middle

    (The Witch is in the middle, the Witch is in the middle, the Witch is in the middle, the Witch is in the middle) Something is standing in between me and my sanity
    (The Witch is in the middle, the Witch is in the middle, the Witch is in the middle, the Witch is in the middle) They say my Witch is just a dream, morbid fantasy (<i>Bloody smile</i>)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!) (<i>Bloody smile</i>)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em!
    (Does she really exist?) (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em! (Is it all in my head?)
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!) (Is it really a witch there?)
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em! ([Unintelligible])
    (Wake the dead! Wake the dead! Wake 'em!) ([Unintelligible])
    I say wake the dead, wake the dead, wake 'em! ([Unintelligible])

    Two trucks having sex
    Two trucks having sex
    My muscles, my muscles
    Involuntarily flex

    Two trucks having sex
    Two trucks having sex
    My muscles, my muscles
    Involuntarily flex

    Two pickup trucks
    Making love
    Built Ford tough
    Two beautiful murder machines
    American angels in the sky
    Grown men cry

    Two trucks having sex (Oh yes)
    Two trucks having sex (Oh yes)
    My muscles (Uh) My muscles (Uh)
    Involuntarily flex (Uh)

    Two trucks, having sex (Oh yes)
    Two trucks, having sex (Oh yes)
    my muscles (Uh) my muscles (Uh)
    Involuntarily flex

    Right by my side
    There's ZZ Top
    And Robert Z'Dar
    From Maniac Cop
    1 2 and 3
    This barbecue could bring you to your knees
    And so could these two trucks

    Two trucks holding hands
    Two trucks holding hands
    The passion, the passion
    Is more than I can withstand

    Two trucks holding hands
    Two trucks holding hands
    The passion, the passion
    My big fat heart expands

    Two pickup trucks
    One cylinder block
    Crush my body
    Like a rock, so beautiful
    No stars tonight
    Just fireworks and eagles in the sky
    The Founding Fathers cry

    Two trucks having sex (Oh yes)
    Two trucks having sex (Oh yes)
    My muscles (Uh) my muscles (Uh)
    Involuntarily flex

    Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
    Two trucks, having sex (oh yes)
    my muscles (Uh) my muscles (Uh)
    Involuntarily
    Huh! (Flex)
    Yeah-yeah-yeah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Two trucks having sex
    Two trucks having sex
    My muscles, my muscles
    Involuntarily flex!

    Two trucks having sex
    Two trucks having sex
    My muscles, my muscles
    Involuntarily flex!

    Two trucks (Having sex)
    Two trucks (Having sex)
    Two trucks (Having sex, having sex, having sex)

    Two trucks (Having sex)
    Two trucks (Having sex)

Lyrics: |-
    I used to rule the world
    Seas would rise when I gave the word
    Now in the morning, I sleep alone
    Sweep the streets I used to own

    I used to roll the dice
    Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
    Listen as the crowd would sing
    Now the old king is dead, long live the king
    One minute, I held the key
    Next, the walls were closed on me
    And I discovered that my castles stand
    Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

    I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
    Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    My missionaries in a foreign field
    For some reason I can't explain
    Once you'd gone, there was never
    Never an honest word
    And that was when I ruled the world

    It was the wicked and wild wind
    Blew down the doors to let me in
    Shattered windows and the sound of drums
    People couldn't believe what I'd become
    And revolutionaries wait
    For my head on a silver plate
    Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
    Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

    I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
    Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
    Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    My missionaries in a foreign field
    For some reason I can't explain
    I know Saint Peter won't call my name
    Never an honest word
    But that was when I ruled the world

    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
    Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

    (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) Hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
    (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
    (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) Be my mirror, my sword and shield
    (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) My missionaries in a foreign field
    (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) For some reason I can't explain
    (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh) I know Saint Peter won't call my name
    Never an honest word
    But that was when I ruled the world

    Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
    Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
    Mmm, mmm...

Lyrics: |-
    Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
    But I can juggle, oh
    Dead dirty carnies
    I'm just a juggalin' juggla, juggalin'
    Jugglas!
    Jokero juggalo
    Well, you know the Juggla
    I'm the Jugga-lugga-locoro
    Well, you know the Juggla
    Dead dirty carnies, dead juggalos
    The room of joker-o's
    But I can juggle, oh, like you never thought you'd ever know
    Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
    Juggla, J-ay-ay
    Jugglas!
    Now shut your ass up and let the Juggla sing

    What is a juggalo? Let me think for a second (Well?)
    Oh, he gets butt-naked
    And then he walks through the streets, winking at the freaks
    With a two-liter stuck in his butt-cheeks
    What is a juggalo? He just don't care (Don't care)
    He might try to put a weave in his nut hair
    'Cause he could give a fuck less what a bitch thinks
    He tell her that her butt stinks, and all that
    What is a juggalo? He drinks like a fish
    And then he starts huggin' people like a drunk bitch
    Next thing, he's pickin fights with his best friends
    Then he starts with the huggin' again, fuck!
    What is a juggalo? A fucking lunatic (Tick tock)
    Somebody with a rope tied to his dick
    Then he jumps out a ten-story window
    Oh!

    (What is a juggalo?) A juggalo? Ax what it is, well, fuck if I know
    (What is a juggalo?) I don't know, but I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo
    (What is a juggalo?) A juggalo? Ax what it is, well, fuck if I know
    (What is a juggalo?) I don't know, but I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo

    Southwest? (We juggalos)
    Down river? (We juggalos)
    Jefferson? (We juggalos)
    Fuckin' everybody (We juggalos)
    I'm the jugga-lugga-loc-a-roni
    (Shut the fuck up. Get the fuck the out of here.)

    What is a juggalo? A dead body
    Well, he ain't really dead, but he ain't like

    At least, he got a job; he's not a dumb putz
    He works for himself scratching his nuts, ha

    He powerbombs motherfuckers into thumbtacks
    People like him 'til they find out he's unstable
    He Sabu'd your momma through a coffee table (Oh my God!)

Lyrics: |-
    25 years and my life is still
    Tryin' to get up that great big hill
    Of hope, for a destination
    I realized quickly when I knew I should
    That the world was made up of this brotherhood
    Of man, for whatever that means

    And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
    Just to get it all out what's in my head
    And I, I am feeling
    A little peculiar
    And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
    And I take a deep breath and I get real high
    And I scream from the top of my lungs
    What's going on?

    And I say, hey-ey-ey
    Hey-ey-ey
    I said hey, what's going on?
    And I say, hey-ey-ey
    Hey-ey-ey
    I said hey, what's going on?

    Ooh, ooh
    Ooh
    Ooh, uh huh
    Ooh, ooh
    Ooh
    Ooh, uh huh

    And I try
    Oh my God, do I try
    I try all the time
    In this institution
    And I pray
    Oh my God, do I pray
    I pray every single day
    For revolution

    And so I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
    Just to get it all out what's in my head
    And I, I am feeling
    A little peculiar
    And so I wake in the morning and I step outside
    And I take a deep breath and I get real high
    And I scream from the top of my lungs
    What's going on?

    And I say, hey-ey-ey
    Hey-ey-ey
    I said hey, what's going on?
    And I say, hey-ey-ey
    Hey-ey-ey
    I said hey, what's going on?

    And I say, hey-ey-ey (Wake in the morning and step outside)
    Hey-ey-ey (Take a deep breath and I get real high)
    I said hey, what's going on? (And I scream)
    And I say, hey-ey-ey (Wake in the morning and step outside)
    Hey-ey, yeah yeah yeah (Take a deep breath and I get real high)
    I said hey, what's going on? (And I scream)

    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west

    I used to live downtown, 129th Street
    Convent, everything's upbeat
    Parties, ball in the park
    Nothing, but girls after dark
    We chill, nobody gets ill
    In the place we call the hill
    But if you try 'em
    That's when they will
    Get wild, but they don't fight, they kill
    At the—

    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west

    I remember parties out in the park
    With the girlies, rubbing up in the dark
    I was smooth, until someone pulled a gun
    It was over, they spoiled my fun
    I was flying, just like a track star
    Dying, nah, I ran through the back yard
    Trying to get into my building
    Saying "Why in the heck won't somebody kill them?" (Wild Wild West)
    One day the fellas got together
    They vowed that no one would ever
    Come on our block, and terrorize us
    The gangs that used to do it, now they idolize us
    Guns, we don't like to use them
    Unless, our enemies choose them
    We prefer to fight you on like a man
    And beat you down with our hands and bodyslam
    You at the—

    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west

    We don't start trouble, but boy do we end it
    Our time, we like to spend it
    Snapping, boy do we heat up
    But we'll take time out to beat up
    A sucker, if he wants static
    Beatdown, yeah we got it
    Good, and we'll accommodate you
    Thanks to us, a lot of brothers hate to
    Come back, to this very day
    'Cause losing's one thing we don't play
    If you're ever in a fight and you're beating one of us
    Break out, before you get bumrushed
    At the—

    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west

    I'm talking about Nappy Red, Theo, Tony and Milton
    Mike Mike Sluggo and Mike Chillion
    D.O.B., Reggie B, and Sidney
    Dano B, Derrick B, Sean B, and don't forget
    Big Hank, Don Ice and Sire Rock
    God bless Peter Wax, Chuck Chuck, and Pork Chop
    El Dorado George way back in the day
    Had all the brothers on the hill talking this way
    They said, God, have mercy L.A
    Sunshine, and my DJ
    Easy Lee, are from around the way
    Jock Jock, Philly Phil, Don D always
    But they're chillin', Keith Keith, KV
    Steve O, Ross Ross and A Fi
    Beroni, Toss Toss and Hung Hunk
    We fight with our hands and nobody's a punk!
    At the—

    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west
    The wild wild west

    Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
    And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

    And backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
    I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
    I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

    And all the roads we have to walk are winding
    And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
    There are many things that I would like to say to you, but I don't know how

    Because maybe
    You're gonna be the one that saves me
    And after all
    You're my wonderwall

    Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
    And by now, you shoulda somehow realised what you're not to do

    (Hey, what's up, it's your boy, uh Mush. As much as I'd love to say Dave, uh, it's not really... really me. Now, this is a bit different than my sweet beatboxing skills, uh and/or/and/or parody songs, which aren't really parodies they— whatever. Basically I'm gonna be talking about Homestuck. Whoof, baby, what a comic! You have fucking magical bullshit kids going in doing triple flips, aliens, you know all the good stuff. And uhh, it's fun! I enjoy it. It's a grand, grand time. It's fun. Uhh, there is, as most popular things do, there is a Reddit page for it. And, in that Reddit page there's plenty of fanart, fucking shitposting and all that jazz, whatever, it's cool. But uh, it's moderated by this guy named [[artist:makin|Makin]]. May-kin? It's M-A-K-I-N. There's no apostrophe, so it's like... Makin. Mack in— I don't know, he's a bit of a fucking cock? He's so fucking disoriented, fucking hypocritical, condescending, total f— just a cockhandle in general. And uh, he's like, screaming about one thing, and then he goes on and starts liking this comic, which is literally just memes, and, honestly I probably wouldn't care about that as much if not for the fact that he's like the main guy that everyone's like, oh yeah he's controlling I don't f— the Reddit and the Discord group. The Discord fucking group is a huge goddamn waste of time and it's also just a lot of bullshit people screaming at each other and shitposting, and every now and again you'll get a nugget of just like, oh, that's interesting conversation! But then it'll go back to screaming, and just, well if— if you want that, look at one of my other thing, which is like uh, when you're scrolling through a convo, and it's, that's basically just screaming, that's basically what the Homestuck thing is. And also, hold on, wait, no, no don't leave. There's also another thing I gotta say. The fucking, I don't even— I'm not even gonna look up what it's called but it's like [[group:canmt|New and Great Comic]] or whatever? That shitty, re— trying to uh play off of Homestuck like oh eh eh eh look how cool it is! That's just memes. That is just memes! And it fucking sucks? And I don't know how anyone likes it! I mean it's fine, you can enjoy it, but I don't. But don't fucking like, fucking hang me from a cross saying that I'm like the worst guy ever because I don't like it. I'm sorry, I just find like, overuse of memes to be rather, just unappealing and boring. But 'pparently everyone fucking gets their goddamn jammies wet. And I don't know, I feel like it's just kind of dumb, fucking, like okay we get it, memes are funny. But not all the fucking time? And even Makin knows that, he's like, eyyy I'm so smart, fucking, I don't really like memes all the time, but then he fucking, strokes this goddamn comic's cock like it's the best next thing. Maybe he can't let go that Homestuck's dead, but I don't know he fucking hated the ending, he's just like, it's the worst thing ever! Hey uh Makin I didn't r— I didn't really like Collide. [blubbering] Uh, hey Makin, I thought the music for this is just kinda meme stuff and I didn't really like it that much? I'm, I'm sorry, but you know, I that's just my opinion. Duh, I thought you— I thought you were like someone intelligent, but now I have, now I know you have no taste! It's like okay Makin, let's fucking, let's fucking take a little chill pill, okay? [blubbering] No no, Makin Makin, chill out chill out. [blubbering] No Makin! Take a chill pill. [blubbering] Alright, well this is my opinion on things— No! No! [blubbering] What, no! That is wrong! That is, I could not believe you would think that, obviously you're a fucking retard! It's like okay Makin let's fucking chill out, okay? Holy fuck! If Makin disagrees with something that you think is right, or you have an opinion on something that uh, it is like not the same thing as Makin's, he'll flip his fucking shit! It's like alright Makin, are you fucking like, thirteen? Or are you fucking, like are you gonna act your age? Also he's called the fucking salt king or whatever the fuck, and somehow that's good? Salty means that you're always angry, and a bit— bit of a bitch? So I mean if Makin's taken that title, phew, man, hate to see what a, oh boy, yeah you get the point. Uh, why'd I do this? I don't know, I was hearing a lot of fucking bullshit. Also, I left that group because Makin was being a fucking piece of shit to me, just fucking screaming at me. It's just kinda dumb, I enjoy Homestuck, then when this shit happens it's just like, great, uhh there's good parts of the fandom and then there's this. I'm sitting here like, dude, let's do some comics, let's do some music, let's do some fucking voice act— that's fun. Then it's like hey, uhh, what about we just be super cancerous and uhh, make like a buncha shit. Um, but you have so much other stuff you can do. You have good, like, music people who are willing to do music. But, like w-wh-w-w-wha-what if we made, what if we made memes! I mean, yeah that's fun, but how about some... real stuff? Naaaaaah... naaah... nah, I like memes. Alright, fine. So what was t— was the point of this? I don't fucking know. I just wanted to talk about something, and also, I mean I don't know if other people will agree with me with this, but Makin's a fucking cock. The Discord server's fucking disorganized and horrid, fucking, Christ, the fucking not safe for work part of it is like, you gotta be eighteen or older! Ehh, ehh, why? Uh we're we're doing it 'cause of legal reasons! Who's fucking looking at this? No one dude. Also, like who's checking the ages? Literally all you have to do is say I'm eighteen, and they're like alright, come on in. Who fucking— the people who don't wanna go to not safe for work is not gonna go where it's not safe for work! Who fucking cares? If some fucking thirteen-year-old posts his dick! Fucking, people getting in fights with the moderators, fucking moderators being cockhandles, fucking admins being like [blubbering] whatever. It's not, it's not good. Well that's just my opinion, it's my opinion, lemme just put my hand up and say that so, I don't get fucking shot to the head by uh, some kid who's like, it's the best Discords what the fuck are you on! I don't know! This is getting too long, whatever, I'm— I'm not even gonna fucking edit this, I'll post this and uhh and I'll see what the reaction is. Either people being like, yeah it makes sense, people being like it's okay, or I'm just gonna get an onslaught of just screaming and Makin be like, you fucking bad! Anything you do I'm gonna fucking delete, ugh! 'Cause that's the kind of guy Makin is, the cockhandle. Though i— though he'll fucking show this and be like, hoh, thf— look at Mush, look at Mush, dude. Ugh, he fucking— he thinks he's so cool? Yeah, well, lemme say a bad th— a few bad things about Mush! Mush, oh my god! And everyone's gonna be like, okay, and then they're gonna forget about it after like a week and everything is gonna fucking go back to the way it was.

    Also, Collide, fucking, sucks! I don't cares, it sucks my fucking fat beef truncheon! Fuck you! I love you guys. Heart. Kissy face. Winking cat face. Alright I'm done.)
