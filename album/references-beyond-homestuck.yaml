    <i>AN APPLE DISASTER!!</i><br>That's the name of her song<br>And her name is Apple Girlington<br>She's the personification of<br>An apple
    This spell card is called <i>THE APPLE WIZARD OF MOUNT FUJI</i><br>It's part of important Japanese folk lore<br>The pre-battle dialogue goes like this:
    <i>You should taste my wonderful apples</i><br><i>No, sorry, I'm watching my weight recently</i><br><i>No!! You have to try the apples or I won't let you through!</i><br><i>Oh, well, I'll give you a diabetes bow tie</i><br><i>[UNTRANSLATABLE JAPANESE IDIOM]</i>
    Then you have a weird chord change<br>Because it's a newer Touhou song
    Then they make a joke about apple pie

Lyrics: |-
    (I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. Do you know what it is? It's my credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher my credit score, the better chance I have of saving a lot of money. I'm thinking of a number; between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? The number I’m thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It’s between four fifty and eight fifty. And it still happens to be between my buttocks. The higher this number is that’s between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. Do you know what this number is? It’s my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it for me? I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty, and that it’s between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab it? It’s a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and get it? I’m thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won’t you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It’s between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I’m thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I’m thinking of? I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I’m thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I’m thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won’t you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don’t grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I’m thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I’m thinking that it’s seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty. I’m thinking that the number is probably seven hundred and twenty. Won’t you reach in and grab it for me? But I’m thinking of a number that is between my buttocks. Won’t you reach in and grab a number that’s between my buttocks? The number between four fifty and eight fifty is between my buttocks! The number seven hundred and twenty is between my buttocks! If you can reach in and grab this number that is between my buttocks, you can save a lot of money! The higher the number is between my buttocks, the more money you could save between my buttocks. I’m thinking of a number between my buttocks. This number is the aforementioned number between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is, the better chance you have of saving a lot of buttocks on your credit report. I’m thinking of buttocks between my numbers. The numbers happen to be four fifty and eight fifty, and they are between my buttocks. My buttocks happen to be between the numbers of four fifty and eight fifty. This number is seven hundred and twenty. I’m thinking that the number seven hundred and twenty could save you a lot of money. Do you know why? It’s between four fifty and eight fifty, and it’s also within my buttocks. You can reach in and grab a free credit report, that could save you a lot of money. I’m thinking that it’s between four fifty and eight fifty, and could save you a lot of money. Do you know what it is? It’s my buttocks! That you can reach in between! And get a number! That is seven hundred and twenty! That I am thinking of right now. The number is seven hundred and twenty, and you can reach in between my buttocks and get it. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. I’m thinking you can reach in between my buttocks for a number that’s between four fifty and eight fifty and my buttocks. Do you know what you can reach in between my buttocks to get? It’s your free credit report, and it happens for me to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks if you so choose, to retrieve this number, which is seven hundred and twenty, which happens to be between my buttocks. Why don’t you reach in between my buttocks? The higher that the number you reach in and grab in between my buttocks, the better chance you have at saving a lot of money, after you have reached in and grabbed a number, between my buttocks. I’m thinking though, that you might want to reach in and grab between my buttocks, in order to get a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty. The number that is between four fifty and eight fifty is less that eight fifty and greater than four fifty. And between my buttocks! The number happens to also be seven hundred and twenty, a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. But I’m thinking that this number is greater than four fifty. But is it less than eight fifty? It’s seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be your free credit score. The higher the number, the greater chance you have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks, if you reach in and grab it between my buttocks. I’m thinking you can reach in and grab between my buttocks a number that is seven hundred and twenty, which just so happens to be my credit score. Or, you could grab a number that is between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? For me, it happens to be between my buttocks, and the number is seven hundred and twenty. Between my buttocks! You can reach in and grab a number between four fifty and eight fifty that happens so to be between my buttocks. If you grab this number that is between my buttocks, you can get a lot of money. Four fifty and eight fifty. These are the numbers that is has to be between. If you reach in and grab between my buttocks, you could save a lot of money. Your credit score could be saved a lot of. This could save you a lot of money, if you reach between my buttocks. I’m thinking this could save you a lot of money. If you reach in between my buttocks, you could save a lot of buttocks. Save a lot of buttocks in between my buttocks. Reach in between my buttocks and grab the number seven hundred and twenty. Save a lot of money if you grab in between my buttocks and grab a sember that it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. It’s a number between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks, and you can reach in and grab your free credit score which is between four fifty and eight fifty it happens to be in between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, which is also between my buttocks. The numbers four fifty and eight fifty happen to be outside of seven hundred and twenty, which is in between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. Which happens to have the numbers four fifty and eight fifty as the boundaries of seven hundred and twenty. Seven hundred and twenty is a number between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and grab a number. This number is your free credit report, and it happens to be- OH GOD NO! NO! NOO! HELP ME! IT’S EVERYWHERE! YOU CAN REACH IN BETWEEN MY BUTTOCKS! HELP! EIGHT FIFTY! FOUR FIFTY!)

Lyrics: |-
    This first level's song is called Magical Hopalong Cassidy Station.
    This part of the song is just to remind you that it takes place in Japan, in case you forgot.
    This is where we have the sudden transition into the miniboss battle part of the song.
    <i>YOU ACTIVATED MY SPELL CARD, YUGI</i>
    Okay I'm flying toward the ends of the level now.
    Picking up some more uh, powerups.<br>I have not reached max power yet 'cuz it's the first level.
    Now it's coming to a sort of break in the music while you're talking to the boss.

    <i>Solatrus:</i>
    Terra is one of a few tracks I managed to finish in 2009, and is also the first track that I started using my current logo in, however in a much earlier form.
    This song was originally intended to be used in a game, however, it never came to fruition.

Lyrics: |-
    Here in the garden
    Let's play a game
    I'll show you how it's done

    Here in the garden
    Stand very still
    This'll be so much fun

    And then she smiled
    That's what I'm after
    The smile in her eyes
    The sound of her laughter

    Happy to listen
    Happy to play
    Happily watching her drift
    Away
    
    Happily waiting
    All on my own
    Under the endless sky

    Counting the seconds
    Standing alone
    As thousands of years go by

    Happily wondering
    Night after night
    Is this how it works?
    Am I doing it right?

    Happy to listen
    Happy to stay
    Happily watching her drift
    Away
    
    You keep on turning pages
    For people who don't care, people who don't care
    About you

    And still it takes you ages
    To see that no one's there, see that no one's there
    See that no one's there, everyone's gone on
    Without you
    
    Finally something
    Finally news
    About how the story ends

    She doesn't exist now
    Survived by her son
    And all of her brand new friends
    
    Isn't that lovely?
    Isn't that cool?
    And isn't that cruel?
    And aren't I a fool to have
    Happily listened
    Happy to stay
    Happily watching her drift
    Drift
    Drift
    Away

    I can't help it if I make a scene
    Stepping out of my hot pink limousine
    I'm turning heads, and I'm stopping traffic
    When I pose they scream, and when I joke they laugh

    I've got a pair of eyes that they're getting lost in
    They're hypnotized by the way I'm walking
    I've got them dazzled like a stage magician
    When I point they look, and when I talk they listen, well

    Everybody needs a friend
    And I've got you and you and you
    So many I can't even name them
    Can you blame me? I'm too famous

    Haven't you noticed that I'm a star?
    I'm coming into view as the world is turning
    Haven't you noticed I've made it this far?
    Now everyone can see me burning
    Now everyone can see me burning

Lyrics: |-
    (Maybe he's right, maybe there is something the matter with me)
    (I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad)

    Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
    Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
    Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
    The girl who has everything?

    Look at this trove, treasures untold
    How many wonders can one cavern hold?
    Looking around here you'd think
    (Sure) she's got everything

    I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
    I've got whozits and whatzits galore
    You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
    But who cares? No big deal
    I want more

    I wanna be where the people are
    I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
    Walking around on those
    (What do you call 'em? Oh, feet)

    Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
    Legs are required for jumping, dancing
    Strolling along down the
    (What's that word again?)
    Street

    Up where they walk, up where they run
    Up where they stay all day in the sun
    Wanderin' free, wish I could be
    Part of that world

    What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
    What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
    Betcha on land, they understand
    Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
    Bright young women, sick of swimmin'
    Ready to stand

    And ready to know what the people know
    Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
    What's a fire and why does it, what's the word
    Burn?

    When's it my turn?
    Wouldn't I love, love to explore that shore up above?
    Out of the sea, wish I could be
    Part of that world

Lyrics: |-
    I couldn't take it, couldn't stand another minute
    Couldn't bear another day without you in it
    All of the joy that I had known for all my life
    Was stripped away from me the minute that you died

    To have you in my life was all I ever wanted
    But now without you I'm a soul forever haunted
    Can't help but feel that I had taken you for granted
    No way in hell that I can ever comprehend this

    I wasn't dreaming when they told me you were gone
    I was wide awake and feeling that they had to be wrong
    How could you leave me when you swore that you would stay?
    Now I'm trapped inside a nightmare every single f'ing day

    It's like a movie, but there's not a happy ending
    Every scene fades black, and there's no pretending
    This little fairy tale doesn't seem to end well
    There's no knight in shining armor who will wake me from the spell

    I know you didn't plan this
    You tried to do what's right
    But in the middle of this madness
    I'm the one you left to win this fight

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you

    I know you're broken down by anger and by sadness
    You feel I left you in a world that's full of madness
    Wish I could talk to you, if only for a minute
    Make you understand the reasons why I did it

    I wanna tell you that you're all that ever mattered
    Want you to know that, for eternity, I'm shattered
    I tried so hard just to protect you, but I failed to
    And in a prison of abandonment I've jailed you

    I never planned that I would leave you there alone
    I was sure that I would see you when I made it back home
    And all the times I swore that it would be okay
    Now I'm nothing but a liar, and you're thrown into the fray

    This bedtime story ends with misery ever after
    The pages are torn, and there's no final chapter
    I didn't have a choice, I did what I had to do
    I made a sacrifice, but forced a bigger sacrifice on you

    I know you've lived a nightmare
    I caused you so much pain
    But, baby, please don't do what I did
    I don't want you to waste your life in vain

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you.

    You're not the only one who needed me; I thought you understood
    You were the one I needed, and you left me as I always feared you would
    Would I change it if I could?
    Both voices: It doesn't matter how
    The petals scatter now
    Every nightmare just discloses
    It's your blood that's red like roses
    And no matter what I do
    Nothing ever takes the place of you

    Red like roses
    Fills my head with dreams and finds me
    Always closer
    To the emptiness and sadness
    That has come to take the place of you

Lyrics: |-
    This is Garnet
    Back together
    And I'm never going down at the hands of the likes of you because I'm so much better
    And every part of me is saying "Go get her"

    The two of us ain't gonna follow your rules
    Come at me without any of your fancy tools
    Let's go, just me and you
    Let's go, just one on two

    Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able
    Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
    I can see you hate the way we intermingle
    But I think you're just mad 'cause you're single

    And you're not gonna stop what we made together
    We are gonna stay like this forever
    If you break us apart, we'll just come back newer
    And we'll always be twice the gem that you are

    I am made
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of

    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    Lo-o-o-o-ove

    This is who we are
    This is who I am
    And if you think you can stop me
    Then you need to think again

    'Cause I am a feeling
    And I will never end
    And I won't let you hurt my planet
    And I won't let you hurt my friends

    Go ahead and try and hit me if you're able.
    Can't you see that my relationship is stable?
    I know you think I'm not something you're afraid of
    'Cause you think that you've seen what I'm made of

    But I am even more than the two of them
    Everything they care about is what I am
    I am their fury, I am their patience
    I am a conversation

    I am made
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    And it's stronger than you

    L-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    L-o-o-o-ove
    And it's stronger than you

    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    O-o-o-o-of
    Lo-o-o-o-ove
    And it's stronger than you

    Lo-o-o-o-ove

    Maybe you're better off with her
    I think she's better for you
    I forgot how great it felt to be us
    Guess I got carried away

    I had to use you to make me feel strong
    But I don't care about that now
    I see a tower built out of my mistakes
    And it all comes crashing down

    Is there something I can do
    Is there something I can do
    Is there something I can do
    Can I make it up to you?

Lyrics: |-
    If you're evil, and you're on the rise
    You can count on the four of us taking you down
    'Cause we're good and evil never beats us
    We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas

    We are the Crystal Gems
    We'll always save the day
    And if you think we can't
    We'll always find a way

    That's why the people of this world believe in
    Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl, and Steven!

    If you could only know
    What we really are
    When we arrived on Earth
    From out beyond your star

    We were amazed to find
    Your beauty and your worth
    And we will protect your kind
    And we will protect your Earth
    And we will protect your Earth
    And we will protect you!

    I will fight for the place where I'm free
    To live together and exist as me
    I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz
    And everything that she believed in

    I will fight for the world I was made in
    The Earth is everything I've ever known
    I will fight to be everything
    that everybody wants me to be when I'm grown!    
    The odds are against us, this won't be easy
    But we're not going to do it alone!

    We are the Crystal Gems!
    We'll always save the day
    And if you think we can't
    We'll always find a way

    That's why the people of this world believe in
    Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!

    Aah haa haa, aah haa haa
    Aah ha aah ha, aah haa haa
    Aah haa haa, aah haa haa
    Aah haa haa haa haa haa haa haa haaaaa

    Why would you want to be here?
    What do you ever see here
    That doesn't make you feel worse than you do?
    And tell me, what's the use of feeling, Blue?

    Why would you want to employ her
    Subjects that destroyed her?
    Why keep up her silly zoo?
    Oh tell me what's the use of feeling, Blue?

    An army has a use, they can go and fight a war
    A Sapphire has a use, she can tell you what it's for
    An Agate terrifies, a Lapis terraforms
    Where's their Diamond when they need her Blue?
    You've got to be a leader Blue!

    Yes, of course we still love her
    And we're always thinking of her
    But now there's nothing we can do

    So tell me
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling Blue?

    Ohh
    How can you stand to be here with it all (Here with it all)
    Drowning in all this regret
    Wouldn't you rather forget her?

    Ohh
    Won't it be grand to get rid of it all? (Rid of it all)
    Let's make a plan of attack
    Start looking forward and stop looking back

    Ohh
    Yes of course, we still love her
    And we're always thinking of her
    Don't you know I miss her too?

    But tell me
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    What's the use of feeling?
    Hmm hmm hmm, hmm hmm hmm
    Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmmmmm

    City's breaking down on a camel's back
    They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
    So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
    You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free
    You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
    A melancholy town where we never smile
    And all I wanna hear is the message beep
    My dreams, they got a kissing
    'Cause I don't get sleep, no

    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Turn forever hand in hand
    Take it all in on your stride
    It is ticking, falling down
    Love forever, love is freely
    Turned forever, you and me
    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Is everybody in?

    Laughin' gas these hazmats, fast cats
    Linin' 'em up like ass cracks
    Play these ponies at the track
    It's my chocolate attack

    Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
    Care Bear rappin' in harder this year (yeah)
    Watch me as I gravitate, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown
    With yo' sound, you in the blink
    Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
    With yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
    So don't stop, get it, get it (Get it)
    Until you're cheddar headed
    And watch the way I navigate
    Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good
    Sha, sha-ba-da, sha-ba-da-ca, feel good

    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Turn forever hand in hand
    Take it all in on your stride
    It is ticking, falling down
    Love forever, love is freely
    Turned forever, you and me
    Windmill, windmill for the land
    Is everybody in?

    Don't stop, get it, get it
    Peep how your captain's in it
    Steady, watch me navigate
    Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

    Don't stop, get it, get it

Lyrics: |-
    (Four, tres, two, uno)

    Listen up, y'all, 'cause this is it
    The beat that I'm bangin' is delicious

    Fergalicious, definition make them boys go loco
    They want my treasure, so they get their pleasures from my photo
    You could see me, you can't squeeze me
    I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
    I got reasons why I tease 'em
    Boys just come and go like seasons

    Fergalicious (So delicious)
    But I ain't promiscuous
    And if you was suspicious
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah)
    That puts them boys on rock, rock
    And they be lining down the block
    Just to watch what I got (Four, tres, two, uno)

    It's so delicious (It's hot, hot)
    It's so delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock)
    It's so delicious (They wanna taste of what I got)

    I ain't tryin' to round up drama, little mama
    I don't wanna take your man
    And I know I'm comin' off just a little bit conceited
    And I keep on repeating how the boys wanna eat it
    But I'm tryin' to tell that I can't be treated like clientele

    'Cause they say she delicious (So delicious)
    But I ain't promiscuous
    And if you was suspicious
    All that shit is fictitious

Track: Fruity Pebbles Jingle

Duration: '5:55'

Lyrics: |-
    (Uh... Scott Stutzman... [pronounced 'Stootzman'])
    (It's pronounced 'Thompson'. Scott Thompson. No it's Stutzman.)
    (Okay. Stutzman. Not Stootzman but Stutzman. Okay.) (Stutzman. Stutzman. Stutzman.)
    (And, uh, he's our- my Songwriting 2 student from, uh, Spring Creek, and he's gonna play a little band, uh, ukulele, and...)
    (It feels perfect. Thank you.)
    (Does that sound good?) (Of course it sounds good.)
    (I don't know Scott's song title, you'll have to tell them.) (Oh, okay, well this uh, has a little bit of a story attached. Uh one of my favorite breakfast cereals of all time is... Fruity Pebbles. And I realized the other day that Fruity Pebbles doesn't have a slogan or a jingle associated with it. So what i did was I just wrote a short little jingle that they would probably love to use in one of their commercials. Uh the song is called... Fruity Pebbles Jingle.) [mild clapping] (Thank you I love America too.)

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the best thing about morning
    Those colorful enchanting little specks
    They make my taste buds spring to life without the slightest warning
    In a way they never do when I eat Chex

    Oh Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are the breakfast I've been cravin'
    I shove 'em by the fistful in my trap
    They got vitamins and nutrients and even riboflavin
    And make Cocoa Puffs look like a bowl of crap

    Yeah Kellogg's Fruity Pebbles are a breakfast taste sensation
    They're tiny tasty munchable and sweet
    I'd like to start a bloody war and build a Pebbles nation
    And murder every other breakfast treat

    And the gallows will sway through the night
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    All cereals bow down in fright
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Sycophants and cowards flee
    From Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Captain Crunch on bended knee
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    The balance of the world's askew
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Promise revolutions new
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    What cereal 'mongst other things
    But Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Stays crunchy in the blood of kings?
    It's Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    (Alright, still goin'. Ridin' that Pebble train.)
    City-states and emirates and commonwealths and counties
    Imagine how they will react with glee
    As the early dawn reflects upon all nature's greatest bounty
    Of soybean oil and red dye number three

    Oh ministers and magistrates can't stop the people's yearning
    For the turning of the powers yet to be
    And presidents and potentates can't stop the fires burning
    As we cast their ivory towers to the sea

    And the creatures of the forest hark
    To Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Noble stag and yellow lark
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The innocence of children's eyes
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Will watch that Fruity flag rise
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    United we shall march along
    With Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Some shall die but we'll fight on
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    The fife shall play its soaring note
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    We'll slit every dissenting throat
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    This vow for glory we must keep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Though God himself may turn and weep
    For Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    Do not fear the cleansing flood
    Of Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles
    A breakfast table stained with blood
    And Fruity Pebbles, Fruity Pebbles

    AAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AAAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
    OOOOOooooooo.....

    (I really like Fruity Pebbles.)
    (Well thank you Scott. Thank goodness for comedians. You know? It lightens our day.)
    (It-that-it wasn't supposed to be funny.)

Lyrics: |-
    The Michael Rosen Rap!

    You may think I'm happy
    You may think I'm sad
    You may think I'm crazy
    You may think I'm mad
    But hang on to your seats
    And listen right here
    I'm gonna tell you something
    That'll burn your ear

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap

    I was born on the 7th of May
    I remember very well that awful day
    I was in my mother, curled up tight
    Though I have to say, it was as dark as night
    Nothing to do, didn't wanna breathe
    I was so happy, didn't want to leave
    Then I hear some people give a shout
    "One push, Mrs. Rosen, and he'll be out!"
    I'm telling you, that was a puzzle to me
    I shouted out, "How'd you know I'm a he?"
    Doctor shouted, "Good lord, he can talk!"
    I popped out my head, said, "Now watch me walk!"
    I juked and jived around that room
    Balam-bam-boola balam-ba-diddy-boom

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap

    When I was one, I swam the English Channel
    When I was two, I ate a soapy flannel
    When I was three, I started getting thinner
    When I was four, I ate the dog's dinner
    When I was five, I was in a band playing drums
    When I was six, I ate a bag of plums
    When I was seven, I robbed a bank with my sister
    When I was eight, I became prime minister
    When I was nine, I closed all the schools
    When I was ten, they made me king of the fools

    So that's what I am, that's what I be
    With an M, with an I, with a K, with an E
    That's what I am, that's what I be
    Mr. Mike, Mr. Michael, Mr. Rosen, Mr. Me

    A hip, hop, a hip hop hap
    I'm giving you all the Michael Rosen Rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap-rap...

    Fushigi da ne ima no kimochi (<i>This feeling, it's strange, isn't it?</i>)

    <i>Undertale Wiki:</i>
    (<a href="https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Flowey">Fandom</a>)
    Flowey's laugh is not a new asset and can be recognized in other media. It was originally a Warner Bros. sound effect mostly used in Pink Panther cartoons and has appeared in titles such as the PlayStation title <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aBa-iQSkxc">Tomba!</a> and the Homestuck soundtrack [[track:the-lordling]], also by Toby Fox.
