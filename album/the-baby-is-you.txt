    (<i>From the Homestuck Sound Test 4/13/2017 Edition release notes:</i>)
    Simultaneously the worst fucking thing Toby Fox has ever made and his magnum opus that even Undertale cannot surpass, even mentioning this legendary trash opera on the now-defunct MSPA forums was grounds for a ban. Warning: Contains male pregnancy (mpreg), heavy implications of underage sex, implications of incest, time travel, a clip of Karkat saying "MMMMMMMMMMM" that was used in the Act 6 Act 6 Act 1 opening flash, vore, the answer to the Ultimate Riddle, and other absolutely awful shit that has no business being in the Sound Test, or indeed, anywhere. Listen at your own risk, if you dare...

Lyrics:
    EVERY DAY<br>a million babies are born<br>in the united states alone
    many of these babies<br>climb out of<br>vaginas
    others<br>the storks bring them
    some are born out of slime in paradox space<br>thanks to a special video game<br>your mommy used to play
    but regardless of how these babies may be born<br>they all come into the world with a special force<br>called
    LOVE
    this is that story

Lyrics:
    roserap:
    strider let me break it down like this for you
    there once was a violet femme fatale<br>whose violent violin sung sweet without
    the tables of a boy who turned tricks and treats<br>like icy halloween breeze/ so fresh were his beats
    but alone they were weak<br>no revolution<br>together - overtime<br>there was an evolution
    they met on the net and there was a fusion<br>like danimals yogurt breakfast frusion
    hearts<br>and minds<br>and souls<br>and hearts<br>they loved each other you bag of farts
    they promised to be each others baby mommy daddy babies<br>but now theyre both caught in their lies<br>their fingers in another persons pies<br>guilty of another person's scabies
    CHORUS (SUNG):
    strider<br>heart to heart<br>dont treat me like a fool
    you may have played me<br>but my heart waylayed me<br>i wanna be your baby mommy too
    daverap:
    rose i know how you're feeling, i know your emotions<br>i want you to know i mirror your devotion<br>you dont see this kind of depravity on the serengetti<br>whoops there goes gravity, moms spaghetti
    i screwed up, i fucked up, i got screwed and fucked<br>im the baby of bad choices and my little legs are tucked<br>i wanted to be true, make you a faithful hubby<br>but you know i cant do, it's just too much trubby
    we're related rose, thats the problem, not the other<br>we cant be baby mommy daddies because your my sis and im you're brother<br>i have the feelings your feeling, we share the same idea<br>and i know i screwed up and probably caught gonohrrea
    but the truth of it all yo is that.... rose it would have never worked<br>and i hope you forgive me<br>because... actually... im having this baby now<br>i want to say im sorry and that i want to be.......... with you<br>and that what i did was wrong<br>and you can be its mommy and we can get married<br>and not worried about [*] babes
    do you agree
    roserap: yes dave.......... oh yes..................... take me away...........
    <i>CHORUS</i>
    <i>CHORUS X 2 with harmonies</i>
    ROSE: DAVE I LIED.... IM NOT PREGNANT..... IM JUST FAT................<br>dave: oh rose.............. i dont care........... being pregnant might be against the rules of the mpsa forum, but this isn't...........
    (worst makeout sounds ever)
    karkat: im going to throw up<br>john: gross!!! everyone cover your eyes!!! the two naked incestuous pregnant teenagers are..... KISSING!!!!!!
