    i love cheers in songs (i edited the cheers into tobys song for [s] collide, and have written them into a few things) so the sword/shield gym theme really does it for me
    I JUST VERY SELFISHLY ADDED <a href="https://youtu.be/bjAK8D5ytiU?t=82">THESE CHEERS</a> TO AN ALREADY GOOD SONG LMAO
    toby had written a really cool song but i wanted to give andrew some hits that were less on the downbeat for the animation so while i was editing the tracks down for length and extending bits here and there i ended up adding them in because i wanted the section to feel hype

Commentary:
    <i>James Roach:</i>
    the rest of the edits i did for collide were like... timing things. theres a part at the end where we needed one more bar of hits during heir of grief because one extra thing happens (the part where the condesce gets stabbed is the previous 4 bars copied and edited in)
    you might notice this if you're music savvy to the point where you're like wait why is there a 12 bar phrase in an otherwise 16 bar pattern. its because that part wasnt long enough for the animation and andrew suggested asking to re-record it and i was like thatll take too long
