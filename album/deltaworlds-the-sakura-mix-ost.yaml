    Artistic project made for fun!

    <i>Deltaworlds: The Sakura Mix:</i> (YouTube video description, deleted)

    <b>Important information about this project</b>:
    Think about it as some kind of Undertale/Deltarune AU, but instead of taking any of this seriously, it's just a way to experiment with the characters, their personalities and stories.
    This AU includes many characters from different franchises, such as Yume Nikki, OFF, YIIK, Homestuck, Undertale/Deltarune, etc. But it also includes characters and/or artists from around the world! It's your job to guess their role and imagine their scenarios.

    This project will also bring some old stuff from mine (and from others as well), we will be revisiting concepts and songs from all my history in the communities I've been part of, so join me and enjoy it with me!

    That's what "The Sakura Mix" is all about, use your imagination because everything is possible when you use your head.

    <i>Jebb:</i> (wiki editor)
    There is no actual proof of this statement other than a saved screenshot of the above commentary, as YouTube's themerefresh function makes it nigh impossible to archive anything YouTube related, however i vividly recall at one point seeing uploads of all of these tracks on [[artist:saruky]]'s channel.
    
    It is highly likely that all of the tracks and art without any specified credits is made by Saruky, however, without actual proof all of the unknown credits are marked as made by "Deltaworlds: The Sakura Mix".
