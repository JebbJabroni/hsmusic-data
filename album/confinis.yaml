    <i>horizon:</i>
    As a theme for the Disciple/Signless(Sufferer) pairing, I wanted the song to be haunting, cold, and foreboding, but still beautiful and rich.

    The word confinis is latin for "beside" or "adjacent to" -- in astrology, it is another word for semisextile, which is an aspect of 30Â°. Such angles only occur when two planets are in two signs next to each other; in this case I'm referring to Cancer and Leo. The song (and image, for that matter) both follow this concept of 'togetherness', no matter what may face them -- and you'll see that The Disciple keeps her promise, as she is found in our night sky beside the prophet Cancerian.

Lyrics: |-
    Though rain shall fall and blood shall spill
    I swear on the stars shining up above
    Through war and strife, and winter's chill
    I'll stay by your side, my love
