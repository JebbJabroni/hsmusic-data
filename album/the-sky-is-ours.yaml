Lyrics: |-
    Oh must this be?
    Is this the end?
    After this day will we really leave these things behind

    Don't you cry
    Look at the sky, oh
    Can't you see it smiling down at you?

    No, I thought we would be forever
    Why must we end this way?

    But dearest child you can't look back
    You've lived your whole life for this day

    Sometimes it's painful I know
    Watching these memories die
    But till you've learned to let you go
    You'll never know how to fly

    Child, you must know this nest is
    Only a place to rest and learn
    Learn to be strong
    Someday when you have flown
    This I have always known
    I'll pray you find a place you belong

    Yes it's painful I know
    Watching these memories die
    But wherever you go
    we're under the same blue sky
    You must go, you must leave this nest
    Take flight, see the very best
    Of life, seek out that echoing song

    Am I ready, am I too weak?
    Will I find this song I seek?
    Somehow I fear to lose my way
    How can I let the wind whisk me away?
    (How can I let the wind whisk you away?)

    Trust yourself

    You've taught me well

    Take the sky
    Trust your compass

    Yes, it's painful I know
    Watching these memories die
    But till you learn to let go
    You'll never know how to fly
    Birds don't forget how to sing
    No matter how far they might stray
    Don't you know there are some things
    That time can't take away

    I'll learn to let go
    These memories don't have to die
    'Cause wherever I go ('Cause wherever you go)
    We're under the same blue sky
    You have taught me to sing
    And someday I'll find you that song
    This is farewell, I suppose
    But who said this is the end? So long
