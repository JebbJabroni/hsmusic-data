Lyrics: |-
    Not a word i could say
    Not a breath i could take
    I can't even compete
    Always knew
    It would never get through
    Since i was barely sixteen

    But i'm trying
    Still i'm trying

    Ive been wandering my way through these worlds
    And asking you what you see
    Everyone i can trust just tells me
    I should take it easy

    I end up crying
    End up crying

    Please don't tell me
    That you know the
    Endless rhythm of everything
    I was forged in
    Greater storms than
    Anything i can throw at me

    Then a push meets a shove
    From so high up above
    And i fall at your feet
    Patch me up
    From the weight of a love
    That i can nеver complete
    
    'causе we're dying
    Slowly dying

    Then i fall once again
    But i don't call a friend
    I can do it myself
    Take the shadows of worlds
    That had never unfurled
    Off of the high shelf

    It's an anatomy of a hierarchy
    Of a place that had no space for me
    It's an anatomy of a hierarchy
    Of "i will carry your sins no further past here"

    There's a clockmaker
    There's a warm place
    Everything is a melody
    Lost when i don't hear the tempo
    Stumbling round on my two left feet but
    I was forged in
    Greater storms than
    Anything i can throw at me
    I will dance in these
    Changing tides till the
    Ocean dances right back with me

    There's a metronome
    There's a warm place
    Everything is a melody
    Lost when i can't see the clock face
    Hidden metal stripes mark our fate but
    I was forged in
    Greater storms than
    Anything i can throw at me
    I will dance in these
    Changing times till the
    Universe learns to sing with me
