Lyrics: |-
    toridori no irotachi ga tsumugu honō no rasen (<i>Various colors weave into a spiral of flame</i>)
    hateshi naku tsudzuite ku haruka kara uketsuida hikari (<i>Continue endlessly, the distant, inherited light</i>)

    sora ga ochita ano hi-me ni shita no wa (<i>The sky fell before our eyes on that day</i>)
    kuchi ru myōjō ka tsukinai yoiyami ka (<i>Is it a dying star or an endless twilight?</i>)

    towa ni tsudzuku yōna shijima no naka (<i>In between the everlasting silence</i>)
    musū no tamashī ga hono kana kodō o utsu (<i>Countless spirits, a faint heartbeat</i>)

    inochi no tomoshibi subete no hitotachi (<i>Everyone's lights of life</i>)
    fukinukete yuku kaze ni mi o yudaneta mama (<i>Entrusting their bodies to the wind blowing through</i>)

    ikerumono ga kasukana hikari o hanachi kieru (<i>Living things release faint light</i>)
    yūkyū no toki no naka kakeru sadame to kizuna (<i>Run in the heart of eternity, destiny and bonds</i>)

    toridori no irotachi ga tsumugu honō no rasen (<i>Various colors weave into a spiral of flame</i>)
    hateshi naku tsudzuite ku haruka kara uketsuida hikari (<i>Continue endlessly, the distant, inherited light</i>)

    meguru inga no naka ikiga mebuki (<i>A breath sprouts in the fate that surrounds</i>)
    arata naru inochi ga tsutsumu kono daichi de (<i>New life will cover this earth</i>)

    tatakai majiwaru subete no hitotachi (<i>Everyone caught in the struggle</i>)
    tachiagari fumidashite asu e susumiyuku (<i>Stand, step forward, and advance towards tomorrow</i>)

    ikerumono ga kasukana hikari de orinasu hoshi (<i>Living things weave faint light into a star</i>)
    yūkyū no kanata made tamashi-tachi wa utau (<i>Spirits sing to the distant eternity</i>)

    toridori no irotachi ga tsumugu honō no rasen (<i>Various colors weave into a spiral of flame</i>)
    hateshi naku tsudzuite ku doko ma demo nagare yuku hikari (<i>Continue endlessly, light which flows everywhere</i>)

    ikerumono ga kasukana hikari de orinasu hoshi (<i>Living things weave faint light into a star</i>)
    yūkyū no kanata made tamashi-tachi wa utau (<i>Spirits sing to the distant eternity</i>)

Lyrics: |-
    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

    On that day, when the sky fell away
    Our world came to an end
    In our eyes did a fading sun rise
    In the dark, glimmering shadows

    Silence grows, in the spaces between
    Stretching far beyond time
    Rising up, as a chorus of souls finds a voice
    Flickering through the void

    These little sparks cling on to life
    Everyone caught in the struggle
    And then the storms of change, they fan the flames
    Scattering ashes to the wind

    Every soul contains a whisper of light
    Gleaming faintly as it dwindles from sight
    No escape, no greater fate to be made
    In the end, the chains of time will not break

    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Search your soul and reawaken the undying light

    As fate spins a thread without end
    New life draws its first breath
    Blossoming in a soil reclaimed from the past
    Where destiny holds fast

    Here where we stand, hand clenched in hand
    Everyone caught in the struggle
    This is the day we finally find our way
    Stepping into our tomorrow

    Every soul contains a whisper of light
    Growing louder as it calls to unite
    From the distance sings a chorus of souls
    Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight

    Every soul contains a whisper of light
    Growing louder as it calls to unite
    From the distance sings a chorus of souls
    Rising slowly, stirring heat from the coals

    Colors weave into a spire of flame
    Distant sparks call to a past still unnamed
    Bear this torch against the cold of the night
    Light will guide you on your way to the ultimate fight

Track: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate Main Theme (E3 2018 version)
## This track is not in the game, however it has been added to simplify the references in the soundtrack. The "main theme" composition turned into the song we know as "Lifelight", and the "Main Theme", the latter of which does not actually exist. There is no Main Theme, outside of variations (E3 2018 version, Piano Solo). Battlefield, Menu, and Galeem / Dharkon are the most explicitely arrangements of this theme. Hence, those songs will be listed as referencing this song. There is no "concrete" main theme in SSBU, no definitive song to be considered *the* Main Theme, only songs referencing the common/shared composition. Lifelight is *not* the main theme, as "Main Theme Piano Solo" exists. As the E3 version is the most "complete" version we have, it will be treated as the common main theme for references.

    F-ZERO!

    F-ZERO!

    He steps right out on the dangerous track
    Stunning skyscrapers lining the perilous path
    Endless Horizon above the sea and deserts
    Silent, impressive, going fast as a valiant horse
    
    For the first to win the Queen’s Distress
    The silent city that fades away into darkness
    Certain to taste fevered kinetic energy
    Sonic booms rip through the rest of the scenery

    Flashing white! (Flashing white)
    Worlds asleep! (Worlds asleep)
    
    From the left to the right, let me first fighting you
    Who lets you do the fighting that we need to burst right through
    Go towards the promise to rock and roll!

    The king’s majesty broker in the silk city
    (in the silk city)
    Dwarf enemies, ride the wind with no pity
    (the wind with no pity)
    
    Once more the sea spreads itself before us
    Cowering the monsters, the heavens up above
    
    The rider up on the burning horizon
    (the burning horizon)
    The monsters of F-ZERO warp into real
    (into real)
    
    Fight to the ending, but don’t let up at speed of sound
    (the speed of sound)
    Pass the power, then grasp the power granted by the gods
    (granted by the gods)

    ステンドグラスを通る光 (<i>Sutendo gurasu wo tooru hikari</i>)
    銀の燭台煌めいて (<i>Gin no shokudai kirameite</i>)
    並んだ笑顔はみんな眩しくて (<i>Naranda egao wa minna mobushikute</i>)
    自分の居場所に絆される (<i>Jibun no ibasho ni hodasaneru</i>)

    夜明けの手を取り高く羽ばたく日まで (<i>Yoake no te wo tori takaku habataku hi made</i>)
    安らぎの縁に身を預けて震えている (<i>Yasuragi no yosuga ni mi wo azukete furueteiru</i>)

Lyrics: |-
    Faint lights pass through colored glass, in this beloved place
    Silver shines, the world dines, a smile on each face

    As joy surrounds, comfort abounds and I can feel I'm breaking free
    For just this moment lost in time, I am finally me

    Reach for my hand, I'll soar away
    Into the dawn, oh, I wish I could stay
    Here in cherished halls, in peaceful days
    I fear the edge of dawn knowing time betrays
