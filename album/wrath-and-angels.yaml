    <i>Devieus:</i>
    A new year, but I'm not done yet. I've started doing <a href="https://weeklybeats.com/music?s=&f=8&y=2014&r=501">Weeklybeats 2014</a> alongside this, though I've been using my ukulele for that. There's none of that here, all digitally made and looping.

    It's like the <a href="https://youtu.be/3M_Gg1xAHE4">pyramid song</a>, 4 times 3/4 followed by a 4/4.

    Angels=choir+harp, vengeance=minor chords. Like most songs here, it loops.
