Commentary:
    <i>Vast Error:</i>
    
    There are many who have designs upon this world
    And dream of wild and vast reformations
    I have heard them talking in their sleep
    Of elegant mutations
    And cunning annihilations
    I have heard them whispering in the corners of crooked houses
    And in the alleys and narrow back streets of this crooked creaking universe
    Which they, with their new designs, would make straight and sound
    But each of these new and ill-conceived designs
    Is deranged in its heart
    For they see this world as if it were alone and original
    And not as only one of countless others
    Whose nightmares all proceed
    Like a hideous garden grown from a single seed
    I have heard these dreamers talking in their sleep
    And I stand waiting for them
    As at the top of a darkened flight of stairs
    They know nothing of me
    And none of the secrets of my special plan
    While I know every crooked creaking step of theirs
