Lyrics: |-
    You wandered in through the doors last night
    With a warm smile and-a bright eyes
    A welcome presence when the snows falls down
    So heavily across this town
    You ask me for a room and a warm cup of somethin'
    Snd we catch each other's glimpse
    You see my cheeks turn red and you laugh a bit
    I stumble over and I grab your key

    How'd you end up here
    Of all places?
    Dumb luck or destiny?
    The weather beats against the windows
    Punctuating our empathy
    And where'd you come from anyway?
    You look so tired, why don't you stay
    A while
    A while
    A while
    A while

    We talked for hours as the days went by
    With a snowstorm roarin' outside
    You told me all about the journey here
    And all the sights you saw all across the world
    And while we're talking, oh, our hands drift closer
    Soon we're right there, face to face
    And when we kiss its like the snow melts away
    So we keep each other warm by the bedside

    How'd you end up here
    Of all places?
    Dumb luck or destiny?
    You shiver underneath your blankets
    I pull you closer come next to me
    The winter weather never lets up
    Maybe we'll bundle up and stay
    A while
    A while
    A while
    A while

    Maybe you could stay here just a little longer
    And make the time pass slower
    Maybe you could make this last forever
    And you could be my lover
    Don't let the sun go and take you away
    We could go together
    Maybe we could make this last forever
    And I could be your lover
