    <i>Desynced:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://desynced.bandcamp.com/album/anthology-ii), excerpt)
    Two sides of the same story... Anthology II features tracks inspired by Desynced's two primary plots. Be it exploring the whimsy and wonder of SURRURAL in DISC 1, or facing the consequences of your actions on EARTH in DISC 2.

Lyrics: |-
    Feel it in your mind
    Your body and your soul

    The river of life
    Has ceased it's flow

    Death has come
    And spirit will go

    But the fountain of youth
    Will forever be told

    To the people of the world
    The faithless and the feeble

    All will search for power
    And yet claim evil

    So keep the story in your head
    And never forget

    Cause the reaper's coming
    When you've got nothing left
