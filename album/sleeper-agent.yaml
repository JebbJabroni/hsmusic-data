    <i>METIANULL:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://metianull.bandcamp.com/track/sleeper-agent))
    yet another jade harley tribute song, featuring her beloved bass!!!

    i often imagine her pouring her feelings out on something thats uncharacteristically melancholic for her. i dunno, being a teenage girl is fking depressing at times!! this track is like my love letter to that more vulnerable and weird side of the beginning acts of homestuck. i mean, come on, these are just some kids getting sucked into a world where everythings insane!!! id miss my home!!! id wanna get the hell out!!!!
