    <i>Toby Fox:</i> (UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE NEWSLETTER - ISSUE 1 (Winter Season), excerpt)
    Pokémon Scarlet and Violet have released! I had the honor of making a few songs for the game: "[[track:tera-raid-battle|Tera Raid Battles]]", the "[[track:academy-ace-tournament|Academy Ace Tournament]]", and of course, "[[track:battle-zero-lab|Battle! Zero Lab]]". I also composed "[[track:area-zero|Area Zero]]", which was re-arranged by my friend [[artist:go-ichinose|Go Ichinose]].

    I also composed a majestic theme melody for the song "[[track:the-academy|Academy]]". Surprisingly, this ended up used as a field theme for the whole game! Though, all songs using the melody were made by other amazing composers. (I love the [[track:one-song-in-mesagoza-if-you-please|the soft piano version]] that plays at night.) Anyhow, that's all I did!

    <i>Toby Fox:</i> (UNDERTALE / DELTARUNE NEWSLETTER - ISSUE 1 (Winter Season), excerpt)
    I also composed "Area Zero", which was re-arranged by my friend [[artist:go-ichinose]].

    <img src="media/misc/toby-fox-go-ichinose.gif" width="498" height="374">
    Also, not an actual reference, but the main arpeggio in this song happens to use the same scale as [[track:alphys]]. It' worth pointing out as the songs end up sounding slightly similar.
##I just find this gif really funny, feel free to get rid of it if it is deemed inappropriate for the wiki^^
