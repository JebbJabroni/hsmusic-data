Commentary: |-
    <i>Makin:</i> (Wiki editor)
    Uh, yeah, I'm not adding all these references. They're not even really hearable so let me quote the original composer.

    <i>Cuil:</i> (Composer)
    there's every song from [[album:cool-and-new-volume-2|volume 2]] and [[album:cool-and-new-volume-ii|volume ii]] in this song and it's late at night and i'm exhausted and im not going to write down every single song from the two albums so let's just say there's a shit ton
