Lyrics: |-
    A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO...<br>far in the depths of paradox space<br>a new lifeform is about to be created<br>one whose origin is as enigmatic as the glimmer of a musclebeast's teat
    some are carried in by storks<br>some are recreated from paradox slime<br>others appear wet out of their best friend's magical nonexistent vagina
    but regardless of how these beings may be formed<br>they all come into the world with a special force:<br>one called
    LOVE
    this is the story of one man's search for love and truth<br>in a universe forgotten by time
    the story of those fearful creatures<br>those that we call
    <big><big><i>BABIES</i></big></big>

    Unofficial name. If I recall correctly, I gave it that name for the Homestuck Sound Test because when [[group:toby-fox]] shared the track on his Tumblr, he shared it alongside a picture of Aradia (and nothing else to identify the song with), almost certainly the [[media:misc/aradias-theme-pre-death.png|same picture I used as track art for the song]] in the first versions of the Sound Test.

    DEBUNK
    <hr>
    The last of my three entries to the Homestuck Music Contest, the other two being [[Guns Blazing]] and [[Vodka Mutiny]].
    A song for Kanaya, this song is - in my opinion - the weakest contender of the lot. Daywalker nonetheless marks my first attempt at using real audio in a song - I recorded the flute performance myself. Unfortunately, my playing, recording, and production are definitely not up to snuff, honestly. Given that it was recorded with a terrible laptop mic, with a player who hadn't played in a long while (me), I suppose that was honestly no surprise.
    However, I love both the harp and flute melodies in this song. It was a blast to play, and I'd definitely think about using them again at some point in the future.

Duration: '4:21'

Commentary: |-
    <i>Tensei:</i>
    I’ll have to do some explaining for this one: I’ve been messing around with vertically layered music composition, and wanted to do something with problem sleuth (that OTHER mspaint adventure). Feel free to skip my blathering below and just listen to the music though!

    I always felt like PS was at least partially a callback to 90s point ‘n click adventure games along the lines of Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc. so this song is intended to reflect that. If you imagine PS as a video game, this is the song that would play at the very start of the adventure while our heroes are messing around in their offices and getting caught up in all kinds of shenanigans.

    Now, the nice thing about PS is that the three main characters (Problem Sleuth, Pickle Inspector and Ace Dick) all have some strong themes that make it easy to come up with appropriate musical motifs. In fact, the three musical instruments that appear fairly early in the comic ( A trumpet, a clarinet and a tuba) all are pretty obviously intended as metaphorical representations of the three heroes, which means that as a composer I have my work cut out for me.

    The idea with vertical layering in this song is that depending on which of the protagonists is currently ‘on screen’, the theme uses different motifs and lead instruments: when more than one protagonist is on screen their motifs are played at the same time and combined. Normal playback methods don’t support this kind of interactive music (many game engines do, however), so this particular version is more of a proof of concept that just demonstrates the different layers and highlights how they interact.

    The first section after the intro belongs to Problem Sleuth. He’s the leader of the bunch, and to reflect his mario-esque all-around average strength, his motif is played on a muted trumpet in the middle register with a combination of short and sustained notes. 

    After that we come to Ace Dick. His motif consists of short notes played on a tuba and backed by trombones and timpani to throw some appropriate weight around. 

    Pickle Inspector goes third with sustained notes played in the higher register of a clarinet. He’s a bit of a loopy character so there’s some glockenspiel and a lot of chroma… chromatics? chromaticity? to give it a bit of whimsy

    The fourth loop combines the motifs of all three characters to demonstrate the interaction between layers when all three are present. The final loop is a variation on the Problem Sleuth motif with an added theremin and a delay effect on all the instruments to give it a ‘spacy’ sound: we’re entering the realm of imagination and the music becomes appropriately screwy.

    Greetings, useless peons
    You've done terrible so far
    Treading venom pools for eons
    Suffering with no scar

    Mercy everlasting
    Hiding who you are
    Welcome to the dark side
    My name is Jack No...
    Iiiiir!

    I'm the overlord of badass
    The shadow magic priest
    Chosen ones cry out for mother
    Of trouble you're the least!

    I really hate these stupid hats
    And that stupid king
    That overarching monarch
    Can shove something up his thing

    (GRAVEYARD STUFFERS)
    Oh yeah, they call me Jack Noir
    You might think that I'm the star
    When really there's a dad who makes me glad
    I haven't had the pleasure, yes to treasure
    This saturnine existence
    'Tween these fenestrated walls

    Goodbye, useless peons
    You were horrible in life
    Jumped off the galleon
    'Thout so much as a Strife
    [[track:archagent-everlasting|Archagent everlasting]]
    I'll tear the sky ajar! 

    Goodnight everybody
    My name is Jack- oh

    Yo, I was out for a while
    Cuz the red miles, Squarewave, get inside my sylladex
    Gotta fix shit now with a freestyle
    My team's a mess and it's all up to reflex

    Shit's kinda typical but this'll be mighty difficult cuz additional syllables
    Got a long road to hoe so let's go now acrobatic fucking pirouette

    C'mon I gotta go faster
    Yo, I'm a blur, colored alabaster
    Got that Crockercorp sendificator
    Absurd, I'm like my own flight simulator
    Zoom, speedyquick like my diction
    Do flips and shit, I'm twistin'
    Don't even care who's list'nin'
    Brace for impact I'm liftin'—
    Off, and I'm not even sweaty
    Though if I were, what I'd need'd be a towel
    Hey, yo, Sawtooth are you ready?
    Here comes a cruxite dowel (Nice catch!)

    Did I mention that I did this 'cause I gotta build speed, I'm relentless
    Gotta penchant, gotta mighty need like an engine, end of sentence; cool re-entrance

    (Yes.)
    (Fuck, yes.)
    (Hell, fucking, yes.)

    Oh
    Damn, a dead Roxy sans grave
    Yo Squarewave, take care of this place
    Now I know it's odd, but I gotta snog
    So go ahead and say it (Yeah dogg!)
    Dude, that's hella gay
    But hey I can't complain cuz the rogue is awake
    That's one down, two to go, or one
    If Roxy finds a way to partake
    (She won't. She's straight.)

    Fuck it, gotta move, Squarewave, see ya later
    Runnin' out of time, livin' on a prayer, got my
    Bucket and my Crockercorp sendificator
    Now as they say it's all gone pear shaped
    There's no other way
    So decapatation is my escape
    Goodbye Squarewave, ja mata ne (<i>see you later</i>)

    Yo, I'm back, did I miss shit?
    No I didn't, this attempt is kinda pathetic
    Doof, bitch, out the way
    Daddy Dirk is taking care of liplocking with Jane
    Looks like everything is okay
    One step left and we're headed to Jake
    Ya better hold on, because this thing is so fast
    Holy shit I'm cool
    
    (Did I tell you how cool I am? Cuz I am so fucking awesome.)
    (It's time for [Unintelligible])
    Grab on to my fucking skateboard, I'm so
    Cool, I saved the day, you're welcome watch this
    Cool shit that I set up earlier it's no
    Big deal, wait I lied it's actually the coolest thing ever!

    I reach out my leaves, and skillfully touch them to sea
    I ship out a boat made of hope on the waves and watch as it slips below
    I am an island, a island that nobody knows
    (...I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)

    I am an island, no man is an island but I'm not a man
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I was raised by an ocean of creatures and brands
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I give what I can of, the fruits and flowers that bloom on my skin
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    But when loneliness knocks, she lets herself in
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)

    Islands don't sink, the water just rises around us
    Just think, someone out there is watching the stars
    But they're not the same as ours, some say they're already dead
    And the light's only on in your head

    I am an island, no man is an island but me
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I warm all my sands by the pyre of my family tree
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    I took to the tundra, I climb every mountain and fight every monster I can
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    To run from that long burning fire, my friend
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)

    I am an island, no man is an island but I'm not a man
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    And messages in bottles feel like battering rams
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    In my head I'm a beacon (In my head I'm a beacon), a pinprick of potential birthed out of nothing but blue
    (I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island, I am an island)
    And the light that I signal, it's shining for you
    (I am an island, I am an island, oh, oh, oh)

    Islands of love, we just want somebody to touch us
    Just 'cause we are distant doesn't mean we are lost
    We are where we are, and whenever a visitor docks
    And is stranded, it means we are not

    You and I have something in common, I will try to share my island (You and I are islands)
    You and I are sinking in tandem, miles apart in every direction (You and I are islands)
    You and I are treading this current, both of us are doomed for certain (You and I are islands)
    You and I are our own now, maybe we'll wash up on solid ground (You and I are islands)
    You and I are islands
    You and I are islands
    You and I are islands
    You and I are islands

    Islands of fate, lately I feel the tides shifting
    They're bringing us closer together to stay
    The waters are rippling, a new world is taking it's shape
    And tonight, our Pangaea awaits

Lyrics: |-
    (Four, tres, two, uno) Four, three, two, fuck you

    Listen up y'all, this shit is ironic
    Strider's beats are best suited to trolls hooked on phonics!

    Karkalicious definition, makes Terezi loco
    She wants to know the secrets that she can't taste in my photo
    Dyin' just to know the flavor, I ain't doin' HER no favors
    No reasons why I tease her flush just comes and goes like seasons

    I'm Karkalicious (So delicious)
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah!)
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail (Four, three, two, fuck you)

    So delicious (Super sweet)
    So delicious (Fuckin' adorabloodthirsty)
    So delicious (Even Egbert wants a piece of me)
    I'm Karkalicious (Li-li-li-li-like candy, candy)

    Karkalicious def-
    Karkalicious def-
    Goddammit, Doc Scratch stop fucking around with my mic-

    Karkalicious definition, makes the shippers crazy
    Nepeta's always squealing cutesy pet names like Karkitty
    I'm the K to the A, R K the A the T
    And the MAJORITY of pairings had better include me

    I'm Karkalicious (So delicious)
    My body stays vicious
    All the highbloods feelin' nervous
    'Cuz I'm doing some fitness

    Zahhak's my witness
    Bet that ship curls Nepeta's tail
    And he'll be needing all the towels
    'Cuz I'mma make him sweat pails (Four, three, two, fuck you)

    So delicious (Super sweet)
    So delicious (Fuckin' adorabloodthirsty)
    So delicious (Even Egbert wants a piece of me)
    I'm Karkalicious (Now you nooksuckers hold the fuck up! Check it out)

    Baby, baby, baby
    If you really want me
    Honey get some patience
    Maybe then you'll get a taste

    I'll be tasty, tasty
    I'll be laced with lacey
    It's so tasty, tasty
    It'll make you crazy

    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D, to the E, to the, to the— I'll just spell it out for you!

    All the time I turn around trolls gather round, always sniffin' at me wanna guess the color of my blood
    I just wanna say it now I ain't trying to round up any drama, little fucker I just don't want you to know
    And I guess I'm coming off as just a little insecure although I keep on repeating how the secret's fucking awesome
    But I'm tryin' to tell, it's a secret that I just don't wanna tell

    Terezi says I smell delicious (So delicious)
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah!)
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail

    (Four, three, two, fuck you) My body stays vicious
    Zahhak's been feeling nervous 'cuz I got down to business
    Nepeta's my witness (Meow!) I'll even let her first ship sail
    Just watch that kitten be the first in line to fill a pail

    So delicious (Eridan, see)
    So delicious (You can trust me)
    So delicious (I'll help you be)
    I'm Karkalicious (Li-li-li-like candy, candy)

    It's so delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    So delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    So delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    I'm Karkalicious (She says my blood is like candy, candy)

    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the— to the— to the— to the—

    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the— now wait just a motherfucking second!

    (Do I seriously have to spell this shit until the very end of the song? I mean, whoever fucking wrote the original never had access to spellcheck I guess, because T-A-S-T-E-Y does not spell TASTY. Was this Fergie douchemuffin illiterate or something? What do you mean human rap artists are the only ones brave enough to write their own grammatical train wrecks and call it music? What the fuck even is Will Smith doing? He doesn't throw down sick fires anymore? Fuck this shit, I quit!)

    Rustbloods, unite! Do not be content to keep your head down with this sax cover of [[artist:james-roach|James Roach]] & [[artist:toby-fox|Toby Fox]]'s "[[track:keep-your-head-down|Keep your head down]]" and "[[track:rustblood|Rustblood]]".

    This cover story was surprisingly difficult to do. Hiveswap (the long awaited sidequest for the Homestuck series) is very new, so there's a real possibility of spoiling things -- and this is especially the case since there are folks who are already familiar with Homestuck and folks who are not.

    This cover story could be like the prequel to the events of Hiveswap, maybe. Or at least, an imagining of something that could fit there.

Lyrics: |-
    Metal joints and moving parts
    Radioactive, glowing hearts
    Send a code to change my mind
    No control, no way to fight

    I've been told what feelings are
    And the ones to show
    A splinter of my other self
    How close, we'll never know
    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires and burn them out
    Code me to break you, tell me to die
    Take my uranium, let the sparks fly
    Let my power run out
    Take my heart and shut me down

    Just a puppet to my code
    Quiet kind of binary ode
    Still I'm here, and I still feel
    I'm trapped inside a cage of steel

    I've been told what feelings are
    And the ones to show
    A splinter of my other self
    How close, we'll never know
    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires and burn them out
    Code me to break you, tell me to die
    Take my uranium, let the sparks fly
    Let my power run out
    Take my heart and shut me down

    I'm so cold
    Thirty seconds left before I explode
    Will I feel it when I die
    Will I wonder why

    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires, burn them out
    Code me to break you, code me to break you
    Code me to break you, code me to tell me to—
    Shut me down, take me out
    Take these wires, burn them out
    Code me to break you, tell me to die
    Take my uranium, let the sparks fly
    Let my power run out
    Take my heart and shut me down

    Shut me down
    Shut me down

Lyrics: |-
    Beneath a smoldering sky crisscrossed with veins
    I rise from our ashes and I take the reins
    I won't allow this blood to stain
    I will rise

    I will not let us fall apart
    For what's a prince without his heart
    I'll play it fast I'll play it smart
    Synchronize

    And I'll escape the miles
    And I'll make Roxy smile
    I'll save the day in style

    And we'll survive
    You know if you guys die well that deprives
    Me of my heart and my spirit and my Strider stride
    And I ain't quite willing to lose all that tonight
    So let's fly

    Ship my head over to Jake for our very first kiss
    And I hadn't really planned that to go like this
    The volcano erupts he hears violins
    Lips meet mine

    And I'll escape the miles
    And I'll make Roxy smile
    I'll save the day in style

    And we'll survive
    Because a prince wakes up
    When you tear him apart
    Hurt my friends and break my heart

Lyrics: |-
    Gears spinning inside your head, silently
    Maybe make a body out of lead if you're ready and
    Lost inside a shell just a little bit proud of your genes
    But blood and breath and bones aren't as helpful as they seem so

    Build yourself a suit of armor
    Encase the heart that still beats fast
    Tighten screws and loosen wires
    And build a soul not made of glass

    It's an easy process if you're not seeing
    Tear yourself apart and pick up all the pieces
    Put 'em all back together with life and hope
    But you lost those 400 years ago

    An easy process if you're not believing
    There's a virus in your system but the trojan is deceiving
    And you find that you'd do anything, anything
    If your heart said go and do anything, oh

    Running throughout every vein, electricity
    And you're running out of fuel but you'll repair yourself at sea
    Talking to the ghost you can barely see
    But they left you all with nothing, but nothing's all you need so

    Build yourself a suit of armor
    Encase the heart that still beats fast
    Tighten screws and loosen wires
    And build a soul not made of glass

    It's an easy process if you're just seeing
    Tear yourself apart and pick up all the pieces
    Put 'em all back together with life and hope
    But you lost those 400 years ago

    An easy process if you're not believing
    There's a virus in your system but the trojan is deceiving
    And you find that you'd do anything, anything
    If your heart said go and do anything

    Well now the record broke, it's your time to shine
    But the gear's are off beat and you forgot the rhyme
    So let's bring it all back, do it one more time

    Gears spinning inside your head, silently
    Running throughout every vein, electricity
    So build yourself a suit of armor
    Encase the heart that still beats fast
    Tighten screws and loosen wires
    And build a soul not made of glass

    <i>SplitSuns:</i>
    ...When the hell did I get 100 followers?? I give my thanks to all of you for listening to my shitty music, haha.
    This is one of my tracks for the CaNMT's almost-vaporware all-vaporwave album, CANWAVE 3. In its current iteration it's a take on 2814's sample-free approach to the vapor aesthetic through ambient and techno albums such as 新しい日の誕生 and Rain Temple. It's one of my most complex songs yet and it took a lot of work to make, but the end result is something very awe-inspiring, even to me.
    (Originally this song was a straight-up cover of Voidlight that was much more laid-back and repetitive, but I scrapped it in favor of this version. Maybe I'll upload that old version somewhere along the line.)

Lyrics: |-
    A shining light so bright on the Internet
    Wriggling with shittiness ever so said
    Made by a man who is golly damn right
    I'm talking to you [[artist:o|o]] on behalf of the web site

    And when you see us shit out crappy complete guaranteed
    A musical shitfest that only I can plead
    We want to say thanks for making it right when it's wrong
    And making it mostly sometimes wrong when it is right

    So relax yourself, you deserve it of course
    Thinking of everything you made in retrospective discourse
    Or should I say [[artist:o|o]] course because the F is paid to respect
    When obviously what else would you even expect

    Happy holidays, I hope you get gifts higher than the high you even have be in order to be that guy
    When a guy like you comes right around it so often looked like a mystery, a riddle, wrapped in a... TV
    So when I say thanks, and on behalf of us all, we mean it well, I mean look at it all
    With all the memes accumulating as one, we wanna say thanks a ton for being there to answer our prayers
    While the Huss man eats his toblerone, and the internet gives him swears

    (Hey uh... drop a beat, [[artist:tirantbacon|Tirant]].)
    (Mmm. Mm-mm-yeah, that's— that's a nice beat. Okay, here we go.)
    Every day when I open the link to Homestuck
    I always feel a little-little twinge, a little twinge of conksuck
    But now the [[artist:o|o]] man's come to answer our prayers
    He's fresher than the fucking Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

    Updating his brand new comic, as cool as he can be
    Showing the absolute fuck out of that hack called Hussie
    So what I'm saying [[artist:o|o]], is that I appreciate your flavour
    And that you'll now be known
    As the Homestuck reader’s saviour
    (Mm.)

    They say it's a Homestuck sequel
    This shit's even tighter than Prequel
    Even if you're as furry as [[artist:svix|Svix]]
    Cool and New make the perfect mix
    Even [[artist:bill-bolin|Bolin]] in his confessional
    Admits there is none more professional
    And the Scottish composer [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm]]
    Weeps at this writing smoother than talcum
    Every morning with my bacon
    I'll go and salt alongside [[artist:makin|Makin]]
    Now it seems my salt is gone
    Cured, perchance, by [[artist:o|o]] and Jhon
    [Unintelligible]

    (Here's some... uh quality content from [[artist:cecily-renns|JohnJMemes]].)

    Hey!
    We're Cool and New, hey!
    We're Cool and New!

    Now listen closely
    Here's a little lesson for webcomics
    This is going down as the best gimmick
    If you wanna be like [[artist:toby-fox|Toby]] Cool and New
    You have to catch Andrew Hussie on the cue

    Just follow my memes, and shit around
    Be careful not to post those leaks

    (ARG)
    (No, don't post that!)

    We're Cool and New, hey!
    We're Cool and New!
    We're Cool and New!

    (Hahaha!)
    Now look at this song, that I have made
    When I hit play, be ready to quake!
    (Random screaming.)
    Uh, let's try something else

    Now watch and learn, here's the deal
    You slip and slide on this banana peel!
    (Hahaha ha ha ha... ha.)

    Hey!

    We're Cool and New, hey!

    (How long can he go on like this?)
    (I don't know. He's never tried to sing Cool and New Web Comic version... entire concept parody [Unintelligible])

    We're Cool and New, hey!

    We're Cool and New!

    We're Cool and New, hey!

    We're Cool and New!
    We're Cool and New!
    We're Cool and New, hey hey!

    (We are Cool and New... we are number one.)

    (Back to [[artist:tirantbacon|Tirant]].)
    Okay that was silly
    And I kind of admit these doritos are getting
    Kinda chilly (Hot you dunkass!)

    Our appreciation for this webcomic is more than Cool and New
    That's right [[artist:o|o]] we're still talking to you
    It's about an ignited fixation of concentration causation
    That results in the fiery blazin' of fandom inflation
    Without the Cool and New, our thoughts of it all would be way past due
    And our interested infested uh re-rearranged contested ideas got molested
    By a man with all the fame and bold calamity
    And then taken over by lame and old insanity
    A wicked tyrannity

    And it makes people say
    [[artist:o|o]] my god

    [[artist:o|o]], reading off the script right now
    I think you're the guy that everyone knows how
    The-here's-you're... dude who's made a lot of shit come true
    And you're rocking the shitfest that is Cool and New
    So when I say thanks, I mean it well
    Ju-judging by the fact that we're pretty much still here lel
    Near enough it's been amazing adventure
    And even when Cool and New Web Comic's ended it will be quite the quencher
    Goodbye, I hope you have a Merry... Merry Halloween
    And from everyone on the Cool and New Web Comic, um, Music Team, we wish you all the best!
    (Thank you for Cool and New Web Comic! You're great dude! Goodnight.)

    And it will come (It's the Nutshack!) (Oh shit!) Like a flood of pain
    Pouring down on me (Oh my God!) (It's the Nutshack!)

    And it will not let up
    Until the end is here (Son of a bitch!)
    And it will come through the darkest day (Smoke weed everyday!)
    In my final hour
    And it will never rest until the clouds are clear (You're going straight to hell!)
    Until it finds my dreams have disappeared

    [MUDA MUDA MUDA] [ORA ORA ORA]

    (NOO GOD! NO. GOD. PLEASE. NO. NO!!! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!!)
    (Ah, fuck. I can't believe you've done this.)

    (Yuu)
    X gon' give it to ya (What?)
    Fuck waitin' for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (Uh)
    Knock-knock, open up the door, it's real
    With the non-stop pop-pop from stainless steel
    Go hard, gettin' busy with it (Ooh)
    But I got such a good heart that I'll make a motherfucker wonder if he did it (Yeah)
    Damn right, and I'll do it again (Yeah)
    'Cause I am light so I gots to win (Uh, uh, uh)

    Phil's from the soul, Jack's from the P.I
    Horatio the Horat so big-eyed
    Tito Dick, "Dickman" baby
    He reaised Phil and loves the ladies

    Jack is cool and he's lazy, he's still learnin'
    Otherwise Cherry Pie, he's still a virgin (Ooh.)
    Chita, meet the freak of the week-ah (Week-ah!)
    Phil's homegirl, God Jack wanna keep her

    But it's not happenin' neither (No), shake it like a seizure
    Hold on, let me spark this, take a breather (Yeaaah-hahah!)
    Breathe the reefer in my lungs
    I got grapes, what you watching—

    Todokete (<i>Ring out</i>)
    Setsunasa ni wa namae o tsukeyou ka "Snow halation"? (<i>Shall I name this heart-rending pain "Snow halation"?</i>)
    (May yor may yor may may may yor may yor may)

    Now this is a story all about how
    My life got flipped turned upside down
    And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
    (May yor may may yor yor)

    In West Philadelphia born and raised
    On the playground is where I spent most of my days
    Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
    And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
    (May yor may yor may may may yor may yor may)

    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
    Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
    And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"
    (May yor may may yor yor)

    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    The games will never stop, the games will never stop
    Op, op, op, op, op, op, op, op, op op op op op op (May may may may yor may)

    (The year is 2020. President Trump has led our nation into one of the worst econonic recessions in the history of the Earth. Imigrants are pouring through the southern border. Just look at that chaos! If you thought the econony was bad with Obana in charge, think again! And not only has Trump destroyed the country, but he's running for re-election! His challenger? Representative Cory Booker from New Jersey. It's up to the intrepid Jhon Ebgret to make his way to the White House and assassinate the president, evil Trump, so that he can finally have Cory in the House! Is he a bad enough dude to off the President of the United States himself? Don't turn that dial! It's... CANWAVE TWOOOOOO!)

Lyrics: |-
    When you are old and grey and full of sleep
    And nodding by the fire, take down this book
    And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
    Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep

    How many loved your moments of glad grace
    And loved your beauty with love false or true
    But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you
    And loved the sorrows of your changing face

    And bending down beside the glowing bars
    Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
    And paced upon the mountains overhead
    And hid his face amid a crowd of stars
