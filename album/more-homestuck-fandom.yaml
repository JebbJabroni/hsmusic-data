    <i>SplitSuns:</i>
    ...When the hell did I get 100 followers?? I give my thanks to all of you for listening to my shitty music, haha.
    This is one of my tracks for the CaNMT's almost-vaporware all-vaporwave album, CANWAVE 3. In its current iteration it's a take on 2814's sample-free approach to the vapor aesthetic through ambient and techno albums such as 新しい日の誕生 and Rain Temple. It's one of my most complex songs yet and it took a lot of work to make, but the end result is something very awe-inspiring, even to me.
    (Originally this song was a straight-up cover of Voidlight that was much more laid-back and repetitive, but I scrapped it in favor of this version. Maybe I'll upload that old version somewhere along the line.)

Lyrics: |-
    A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO...<br>far in the depths of paradox space<br>a new lifeform is about to be created<br>one whose origin is as enigmatic as the glimmer of a musclebeast's teat
    some are carried in by storks<br>some are recreated from paradox slime<br>others appear wet out of their best friend's magical nonexistant vagina
    but regardless of how these beings may be formed<br>they all come into the world with a special force:<br>one called
    LOVE
    this is the story of one man's search for love and truth<br>in a universe forgotten by time
    the story of those fearful creatures<br>those that we call
    <big><big><i>BABIES</i></big></big>

Commentary: |-
    <i>Tensei:</i>
    The original release version of this song had been mastered at a fairly low volume level in order to match the other songs on the Alterniabound album. I felt that a bouncy electronica song like this warranted a lot more volume and dynamic range compression though, so this version is the song as I had originally intended it. The difference might not be all that noticeable unless you're comparing the versions side by side.

    DEBUNK
    <hr>
    The last of my three entries to the Homestuck Music Contest, the other two being [[Guns Blazing]] and [[Vodka Mutiny]].
    A song for Kanaya, this song is - in my opinion - the weakest contender of the lot. Daywalker nonetheless marks my first attempt at using real audio in a song - I recorded the flute performance myself. Unfortunately, my playing, recording, and production are definitely not up to snuff, honestly. Given that it was recorded with a terrible laptop mic, with a player who hadn't played in a long while (me), I suppose that was honestly no surprise.
    However, I love both the harp and flute melodies in this song. It was a blast to play, and I'd definitely think about using them again at some point in the future.

    <i>Clark Powell:</i>
    I have recut and remastered my track Flare, as it was presented to you in the Cascade flash (rather than the calmed-down album version). I get asked a lot for this, so I decided to give it some extra love and attention.
    I have attempted a number of times to put together a mix of Flare that utilized the distinctive crescendo that is recognizable from Cascade, but it never seems to work well without the cinematic context. The buildup sort of leads to nothing, and then the track either ends awkwardly or fades out, and I have something personal against fade-outs. Maybe I’ll talk about that someday. But not now.
    I gave it another go, this time trying a decrescendo to bring the song back down from all the energy it riles up, then ending it on kind of a creepy note. I had more success here than I ever have in past attempts to cut the song together in this way.
    Flare was a pretty big hit in its own right, so there’s always the pressure coming from the responsibility to handle this properly. I hope you enjoy it!

Lyrics: |-
    (Four, tres, two, uno) Four, three, two, fuck you

    Listen up y'all, this shit is ironic
    Strider's beats are best suited to trolls hooked on phonics!

    Karkalicious definition, makes Terezi loco
    She wants to know the secrets that she can't taste in my photo
    Dyin' just to know the flavor, I ain't doin' HER no favors
    No reasons why I tease her flush just comes and goes like seasons

    I'm Karkalicious (So delicious)
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah!)
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail (Four, three, two, fuck you)

    So delicious (Super sweet)
    So delicious (Fuckin' adorabloodthirsty)
    So delicious (Even Egbert wants a piece of me)
    I'm Karkalicious (Li-li-li-li-like candy, candy)

    Karkalicious def-
    Karkalicious def-
    Goddammit, Doc Scratch stop fucking around with my mic-

    Karkalicious definition, makes the shippers crazy
    Nepeta's always squealing cutesy pet names like Karkitty
    I'm the K to the A, R K the A the T
    And the MAJORITY of pairings had better include me

    I'm Karkalicious (So delicious)
    My body stays vicious
    All the highbloods feelin' nervous
    'Cuz I'm doing some fitness

    Zahhak's my witness
    Bet that ship curls Nepeta's tail
    And he'll be needing all the towels
    'Cuz I'mma make him sweat pails (Four, three, two, fuck you)

    So delicious (Super sweet)
    So delicious (Fuckin' adorabloodthirsty)
    So delicious (Even Egbert wants a piece of me)
    I'm Karkalicious (Now you nooksuckers hold the fuck up! Check it out)

    Baby, baby, baby
    If you really want me
    Honey get some patience
    Maybe then you'll get a taste

    I'll be tasty, tasty
    I'll be laced with lacey
    It's so tasty, tasty
    It'll make you crazy

    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D, to the E, to the, to the— I'll just spell it out for you!

    All the time I turn around trolls gather round, always sniffin' at me wanna guess the color of my blood
    I just wanna say it now I ain't trying to round up any drama, little fucker I just don't want you to know
    And I guess I'm coming off as just a little insecure although I keep on repeating how the secret's fucking awesome
    But I'm tryin' to tell, it's a secret that I just don't wanna tell

    Terezi says I smell delicious (So delicious)
    No I don't do kismesis
    And if you read any fanfics
    All that shit is fictitious

    I blow kisses (Mwah!)
    Don't matter if we're just moirails
    Trolls be lining down the veil
    For a chance to fill a pail

    (Four, three, two, fuck you) My body stays vicious
    Zahhak's been feeling nervous 'cuz I got down to business
    Nepeta's my witness (Meow!) I'll even let her first ship sail
    Just watch that kitten be the first in line to fill a pail

    So delicious (Eridan, see)
    So delicious (You can trust me)
    So delicious (I'll help you be)
    I'm Karkalicious (Li-li-li-like candy, candy)

    It's so delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    So delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    So delicious (Ay, ay, ay, ay)
    I'm Karkalicious (She says my blood is like candy, candy)

    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the S-T-E-Y fuckin' tasty
    T to the A, to the— to the— to the— to the—

    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
    To the D to the E, to the— now wait just a motherfucking second!

    (Do I seriously have to spell this shit until the very end of the song? I mean, whoever fucking wrote the original never had access to spellcheck I guess, because T-A-S-T-E-Y does not spell TASTY. Was this Fergie douchemuffin illiterate or something? What do you mean human rap artists are the only ones brave enough to write their own grammatical train wrecks and call it music? What the fuck even is Will Smith doing? He doesn't throw down sick fires anymore? Fuck this shit, I quit!)

    <i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>
    I'm a little late for 6/12, I know, but I just finished some piano arrangements ([[Rags of Rust]], [[Teal Wings and Scales]], [[Violet Sea Breeze]]) of my tracks from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]. I composed the originals back in January 2012--two and a half years ago! My, how time flies when you're having fun.
    I have to thank my piano professor from last semester for these. No, I can't play these pieces live, not yet at least--but taking a piano course really improved my level of comfort and familiarity with composing for pianos. I just might make sheet music available, though!
