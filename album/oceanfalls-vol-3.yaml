Commentary: |-
    <i>Mathias Ramalhoy:</i>
    (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/friendly-coy/ytu-rendy">SoundCloud</a>)
    Track's name means "Light from the Waterfalls" in Guaran√≠. Ytu comes from "y" which is water, it means waterfall. Rendy refers turning on or light in this context. You can also be a funnyman and use the other meaning of Rendy which is saliva, pretty much what I intended "accidentally" lmao.
