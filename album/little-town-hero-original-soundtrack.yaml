Referenced Tracks: #because this version is Toby-only, I'm inclined to believe this is the origin of the melody. because Mystic Aura is in the same key, I believe it is based on this song, and then Lost Reminiscence is a re-arrange of that in a different key.

- Blood-red Carpet #both songs appear in concept medley. since the part of Neverending Roar with the "Blood-red Carpet melody" doesn't appear, but the melody does appear in the Blood-red Carpet part of the medley, I'm listing Blood-red Carpet as the origin of the melody.
