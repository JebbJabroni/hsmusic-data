<p><strong>Feature requests?<br>Noticed any errors?<br>Itching to see that one album you love on the wiki?</strong></p>
<p>Please let us know! We appreciate feedback a lot, and always want to make this site better.</p>
<p>There are five main channels you can reach the dev through: <ul>
    <li><a href="discord/">HSMusic Community Discord Server</a> - The official Discord, and a friendly place to drop feedback or discuss the wiki. (We also share sneak peeks of the coming updates here frequently!)</li>
    <li><a href="https://forum.homestuck.xyz/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=151">HomestuckXYZ</a> - A public forum thread for the wiki.</li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/sapphicGnostic">Twitter</a> - DMs for discussion or feedback are open! (It might go a while unnoticed, though - the site only indicates message requests when it's manually checked, and we're pretty terrible at remembering to do that!)</li>
    <li><a href="https://types.pl/@quasar">Mastodon</a> - Same as birdsite but a moderately less terrible platform :)</li>
    <li>Email - it's towerofnix at gmail dot beans! (Same domain everyone else uses.) Old-fashioned, but personally our favorite of them all, and certainly practical if you're sending a longer-form message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks so much for sharing your feedback!</p>
