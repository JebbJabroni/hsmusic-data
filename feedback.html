<p>Please let me know! I appreciate feedback a lot, and always want to make this site better.</p>
<p>The best place to talk about this site is on its <a href="https://forum.homestuck.xyz/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=151">HomestuckXYZ forum thread</a>.</p>
<p>Or, if forums aren't really the thing for you, I've got an email too: towerofnix at gmail dot beans. (You know the domain.)</p>
<p>I used to have a Twitter account, but Twitter is bad and poofing from it was probably my greatest decision.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your feedback!</p>
