<p><strong>Feature requests?<br>Noticed any errors?<br>Itching to see that one missing album on the wiki?</strong></p>
<p>Please let us know! We appreciate feedback a lot, and always want to make this site better.</p>
<p>There are four main channels you can reach the dev through: <ul>
    <li><a href="https://forum.homestuck.xyz/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=151">HomestuckXYZ</a> - A public forum thread specifically for HSMusic</li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/sapphicGnostic">Twitter</a> - DMs for discussion or feedback are open!</li>
    <li><a href="https://types.pl/@quasar">Mastodon</a> - Same as birdsite but a moderately less terrible platform :)</li>
    <li>Email - it's towerofnix at gmail dot beans! (You know the domain.) Old-fashioned, but probably our favorite of the four, and certainly practical if you're dropping a longer-form message.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks so much for sharing your feedback!</p>
